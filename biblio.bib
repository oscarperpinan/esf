FCs can be connected directly to a PV generator to power centrifugal submersible pumps driven by three-phase asynchronous induction motors. In comparison with dedicated products, the use of standard FCs and centrifugal motopumps encompasses several advantages: power range, broad range of products and technological independence. This paper describes the main rules to implement standard FCs in PV pumping systems, and presents a model to estimate its performance from standard pumps manufacturers? data.

  Abstract                 = { Small-world properties have been demonstrated for many complex networks. Here, we applied the discrete wavelet transform to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series, acquired from healthy volunteers in the resting state, to estimate frequency-dependent correlation matrices characterizing functional connectivity between 90 cortical and subcortical regions. After thresholding the wavelet correlation matrices to create undirected graphs of brain functional networks, we found a small-world topology of sparse connections most salient in the low-frequency interval 0.03–0.06 Hz. Global mean path length (2.49) was approximately equivalent to a comparable random network, whereas clustering (0.53) was two times greater; similar parameters have been reported for the network of anatomical connections in the macaque cortex. The human functional network was dominated by a neocortical core of highly connected hubs and had an exponentially truncated power law degree distribution. Hubs included recently evolved regions of the heteromodal association cortex, with long-distance connections to other regions, and more cliquishly connected regions of the unimodal association and primary cortices; paralimbic and limbic regions were topologically more peripheral. The network was more resilient to targeted attack on its hubs than a comparable scale-free network, but about equally resilient to random error. We conclude that correlated, low-frequency oscillations in human fMRI data have a small-world architecture that probably reflects underlying anatomical connectivity of the cortex. Because the major hubs of this network are critical for cognition, its slow dynamics could provide a physiological substrate for segregated and distributed information processing. },

Analytical expressions for the probability distribution of k t are proposed (truncated Gaussian functions depending on Kt and h). The results reported in this paper provide a deeper understanding of hourly solar radiation statistics, and explain some of the features displayed by radiation data at longer time scales.

A stand-alone PV system is designed to carry out this work. The I ? V characteristics have been measured simultaneously for both clean and dusty modules. It has been found that the short circuit current and the maximum output power decrease significantly as dust particles start to accumulate on the panel surface up to a concentration of 1 g/m 2 , but the rate of decrease is slower for concentrations beyond that value. The reduction in short circuit current in one sample of study is found to be \&nvsim;40%, whereas it is \&nvsim;34% in the maximum output power. In contrast, it is stated that the open circuit voltage is not sensitive to sand dust accumulation. A significant degradation in },

  Abstract                 = {Existen en la literatura numerosos métodos, incluidos programas de simulación, para la estimación de la energía generada por los sistemas fotovoltaicos conectados a la red eléctrica. No obstante suele haber diferencias contrastadas entre las predicciones y los valores de energía facturada, haciéndose necesario parámetros específicos de simulación para cada instalación en concreto. Este trabajo presenta de modo sencillo una visión de los diferentes factores de pérdidas energéticas que pueden existir en una instalación FV conectada a la red, basados en datos experimentales. Mediante ejemplos se muestra como el âPerformance Ratio (PR)â de una instalación puede variar de 0.50 a 0.75 en función de las pérdidas consideradas, que dependen fundamentalmente de la selección de los componentes del sistema y el modo de instalarlos. Se aplica este método a varias localidades de la geografía española, permitiendo elaborar mapas de producción en función del tipo de seguimiento solar. También se presentan algunas de las herramientas disponibles para la estimación de pérdidas energéticas por efectos del sombreado. En particular, se analizan las pérdidas por sombreado en algunos casos de campos fotovoltaicos de seguidores solares en dos ejes, instalaciones que están en auge en el caso particularizado de España. Finalmente se introducen algunos aspectos básicos en el diseño de sistemas de control para seguidores solares.},

Five module types have been subjected to an outdoor test programme with the purpose of analysing their hot-spot endurance. The worst-case cell in each module type has been detected by laboratory characterisation under reverse-bias operation of all the individual cells included in the module. These cells, encapsulated within the module, have been operated at different shading fractions with bypass diodes around 18 or 24 cells. A data acquisition system has monitored temperatures and current flows during the day, completing the tests via infrared characterisation during the hours of maximum irradiance. The influence of the type of module, the number of cells per bypass diode, the position and amount of shading and the leakage current of the cell is presented. This information is useful for cell and module manufacturers and system installers who must select the necessary protection criteria to guarantee long lifetimes for PV systems; it also helps to clarify hot-spot testing procedures in international standards},

It can be adapted to PV cells in which reverse characteristic is dominated by avalanche mechanisms, and also to those dominated by shunt resistance or with breakdown voltages far from a safe measurement range. A procedure to calculate model parameters based in piecewise fitting is also proposed. The model has been applied to isolated crystalline solar cells measured at different conditions, and also to cells encapsulated in a conventional PV module. Good fitting has been found between the experimental and modelled curves. Evolution of calculated breakdown voltages with temperature is in accordance with avalanche theories.},

In order to validate the model, measurements have been performed in the 33 cells of a conventional PV module previously modified to have access to its cells, either individually or associated. Series and parallel proposed models have been applied to measurements, supposing all module cells are connected either in series or in parallel. Good approximations have been found in both cases.

  Abstract                 = {During data collection and analysis, it is often necessary to identify and possibly remove outliers that exist. An objective method for identifying outliers to be removed is critical. Many automated outlier detection methods are available. However, many are limited by assumptions of a distribution or require upper and lower predefined boundaries in which the data should exist. If there is a known distribution for the data, then using that distribution can aid in finding outliers. Often, a distribution is not known, or the experimenter does not want to make an assumption about a certain distribution. Also, enough information may not exist about a set of data to be able to determine reliable upper and lower boundaries. For these cases, an outlier detection method, using the empirical data and based upon Chebyshevâs inequality, was formed. This method allows for detection of multiple outliers, not just one at a time. This method also assumes that the data are independent measurements and that a relatively small percentage of outliers is contained in the data.},

Here both 1-second and 1-hour samples are used to estimate the power spectrum of several wind farms. The measured output power is found to follow a Kolmogorov spectrum over more than four orders of magnitude, from 30 s to 2.6 days. This result is in sharp contrast to the only previous study covering long time periods, published 50 years ago. The spectrum defines the character of fill-in power that must be provided to compensate for windâs fluctuations when wind is deployed at large scale. Installing enough linear ramp rate generation (such as a gas generator) to fill in fast fluctuations with amplitudes of 1% of the maximum fluctuation would oversize the fill-in generation capacity by a factor of two for slower fluctuations, greatly increasing capital costs. A wind system that incorporates batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors, or other fast-ramp-rate energy storage systems would match fluctuations much better, and can provide an economic route for deployment of energy storage systems when renewable portfolio standards require large amounts of intermittent renewable generating sources.},

To evaluate the limits and competitiveness of PVenergy in Spain, several companies, utilities and institutions have been working together in a project called FotoRED. Within this project, several computer tools have been developed to analyse the potential of connecting photovoltaic stations to the utility grid. One of these tools is the simulator presented here, a program to estimate the energy balance and economic behaviour of grid-connected PV buildings. Depending on several construction parameters of the building, the photovoltaic generators installed, the geographical location, weather conditions, etc., the program estimates the energy consumed in the building, the photovoltaic energy that can be generated on-site and the resulting energy balance on a daily, monthly and yearly basis. The economic behaviour of the building can also be simulated over a 30-year period, generating cash-flow diagrams, investment payback curves and other economic information to describe the buildingâs expected performance. Many building designs and several existing buildings have been simulated with this tool so far. One example of these is presented and the conclusions reached during several simulation runs are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Photovoltaic-battery system is an option for decentralized power generation for isolated locations receiving abundant sunshine. A methodology for the optimum sizing of photovoltaic-battery system for remote electrification incorporating the uncertainty associated with solar insolation is proposed in this paper. The proposed methodology is based on the design space approach involving a time series simulation of the entire system. The design space approach was originally proposed for sizing of the system with deterministic resource and demand. In the present paper, chance constrained programming approach has been utilized for incorporating the resource uncertainty in the system sizing and the concept of design space is extended to incorporate resource uncertainty. The set of all feasible design configurations is represented by a sizing curve. The sizing curve for a given confidence level, connects the combinations of the photovoltaic array ratings and the corresponding minimum battery capacities capable of meeting the specified load, plotted on an array rating vs. battery capacity diagram.The methodology is validated using a sequential Monte Carlo simulation approach with illustrative examples. It is shown that for the case of constant coefficient of variation of solar insolation, the set of sizing curves for different confidence levels may be represented by a generalized curve. Selection of optimum system configuration for different reliability levels based on the minimum cost of energy is also presented. The effect of ambient temperature on sizing a stand-alone photovoltaic-battery system is also illustrated through a representative example.},

From more than four years of solar radiation observations it was found that variations in the frequency distributions of the three indices of optical air mass for Botucatu, Brazil, are similar to those in other places, as published in the literature. The proposed models were obtained by linear combination of normalized Beta probability functions, using the observed distributions derived from three years of data. The versatility of these functions allows modelling of all three irradiance indexes to similar levels of accuracy. A comparison with the observed distributions obtained from one year of observations indicate that the models are able to reproduce the observed frequency distributions of all three indices at the 95% confidence level.},

  Abstract                 = {A stochastic simulation model of hourly global solar radiation is presented in this paper. It is developed by introducing the concept of "time dependent frequency distribution" (TDFD) of hourly insolation values. In this model the two most critical aspects of time series simulation, i.e., the reproduced time series values which have the appropriate time dependent frequency distribution for the parameter being simulated and the correlation between successive values, are taken into account. The elimination of the TDFD of the data and the transformation of the data distribution to a Gaussian distribution (required for the stationary time series analysis) were carried out using a mapping technique. The autocorrelation function of the transformed data showed that the produced time series is stationary. Then, an antimapping coefficient matrix is developed, which provides a simple yet an effective simulation device. The described model has been applied in Athens (Greece) where hourly insolation data covering a period of two years are used. The theoretical results obtained using this simulation model, regarding both the TDFD and the correlation, are in agreement with the measured data.},

  Abstract                 = {Many complex networks have a small-world topology characterized by dense local clustering or cliquishness of connections between neighboring nodes yet a short path length between any (distant) pair of nodes due to the existence of relatively few long-range connections. This is an attractive model for the organization of brain anatomical and functional networks because a small-world topology can support both segregated/specialized and distributed/integrated information processing. Moreover, small-world networks are economical, tending to minimize wiring costs while supporting high dynamical complexity. The authors introduce some of the key mathematical concepts in graph theory required for small-world analysis and review how these methods have been applied to quantification of cortical connectivity matrices derived from anatomical tract-tracing studies in the macaque monkey and the cat. The evolution of small-world networks is discussed in terms of a selection pressure to deliver cost-effective information-processing systems. The authors illustrate how these techniques and concepts are increasingly being applied to the analysis of human brain functional networks derived from electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography and fMRI experiments. Finally, the authors consider the relevance of small-world models for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors and the resilience of brain systems to pathological attack by disease or aberrant development. They conclude that small-world models provide a powerful and versatile approach to understanding the structure and function of human brain systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Brain function depends on adaptive self-organization of large-scale neural assemblies, but little is known about quantitative network parameters governing these processes in humans. Here, we describe the topology and synchronizability of frequency-specific brain functional networks using wavelet decomposition of magnetoencephalographic time series, followed by construction and analysis of undirected graphs. Magnetoencephalographic data were acquired from 22 subjects, half of whom performed a finger-tapping task, whereas the other half were studied at rest. We found that brain functional networks were characterized by small-world properties at all six wavelet scales considered, corresponding approximately to classical δ (low and high), θ, α, β, and γ frequency bands. Global topological parameters (path length, clustering) were conserved across scales, most consistently in the frequency range 2–37 Hz, implying a scale-invariant or fractal small-world organization. Dynamical analysis showed that networks were located close to the threshold of order/disorder transition in all frequency bands. The highest-frequency γ network had greater synchronizability, greater clustering of connections, and shorter path length than networks in the scaling regime of (lower) frequencies. Behavioral state did not strongly influence global topology or synchronizability; however, motor task performance was associated with emergence of long-range connections in both β and γ networks. Long-range connectivity, e.g., between frontal and parietal cortex, at high frequencies during a motor task may facilitate sensorimotor binding. Human brain functional networks demonstrate a fractal small-world architecture that supports critical dynamics and task-related spatial reconfiguration while preserving global topological parameters.},

For an appropriate use of this huge data base convenient methods for the characterization of the spatial and temporal structures of the satellite derived irradiance field are necessary. In this paper we introduce the application of a multiresolution decomposition for the structure analysis of irradiance maps. Using this tool the maps are decomposed into local averages (context) and gradients (detail) on various spatial scales. The information on the context and the detail mav be directlv interoreted in terms that are of interest, e.g. for the anlaysis of PV-systems implemented on a very large-scale.},

  Abstract                 = {Procedures for the performance check of grid-connected PV systems can significantly increase the overall efficiency of PV integration. As for a general applicability no additional local data acquisition except monthly energy meter readings should be necessary, the radiation and temperature data must be derived from remote sources, i.e. data from common meteorological surface networks and/or satellite images. A respective procedure has been developed within the EC-Joule project PVSAT. Site specific hourly irradiance data are derived from METEOSAT satellite images while monthly temperature data are used from the surface network. For the characterization of the PV system, only easily available information should be required. The set of information used by the PVSAT routine comprises the installed power, the types of generator and inverter, the orientation of the generator and a simple description of obstructions/shading to the generator. A test phase of the PVSAT procedure with systems of voluntary participants ended with the result that the monthly yield of well described and properly operating systems can be calculated within an accuracy range of about 15 kWh/kWp. For an increased understanding of the sources of these errors, an in-depth analysis of the procedure has been performed using data from monitored and supervised systems. For these systems, the accuracy of the derivation of both the irradiance information from satellite data and of the estimation of the output of the PV generator were analyzed.},

For PVRO systems, the feasibility is a function of location due to variation in solar resource, water type, system demand and local governmental policies. A series of sample cases were analyzed to demonstrate the method. Analysis for community-scale seawater reverse osmosis systems was carried out for various locations using Geographic Information System (GIS) data. A site-specific analysis has been completed for seawater and brackish water reverse osmosis systems. It was found that photovoltaic-powered reverse osmosis is feasible for the majority of remote locations with a large solar resource.},

  Abstract                 = {High-concentration solar thermal systems require the Sun to be tracked with great accuracy. The higher the system concentration, the greater this accuracy must be. The current trend in solar concentrator tracking systems is to use open-loop controllers that compute the direction of the solar vector based on location and time. To keep down the price of the tracking system, the controller is based on a low-cost microprocessor. These two facts impose important restrictions on the Sun position algorithm to be used in the controller, as it must be highly accurate and efficiently computable at the same time. In this paper, various algorithms currently available in the solar literature are reviewed and a new algorithm, developed at the Plataforma Solar de AlmerÂ?ýa, which combines these two characteristics of accuracy and simplicity, is presented. The algorithm allows of the true solar vector to be determined with an accuracy of 0.5 minutes of arc for the period 1999â2015.},

The behaviour and adjustment between values observed and estimates obtained by neural networks for different combinations of input were assessed. These estimations showed root mean square error between 3.15 and 3.88 MJ m-2 d-1. The latter corresponds to the model that calculates radiation using only precipitation and daily temperature range. In all models, results show good adjustment to seasonal solar radiation. These results allow inferring the adequate performance and pertinence of this methodology to estimate complex phenomena, such as solar radiation.},

  Abstract                 = {Intuitively one decomposes climate variables such as solar irradiation and ambient temperature into their deterministic and stochastic components. The deterministic component comprises a sum of contributions at various frequencies, thereby defining the climate of the location. The stochastic component comprises the fluctuations about this component, giving the day-to-day weather variations. Boland (Solar Energy 60(6) (1997) 359) shows that on a day-to-day basis both components must be included in building thermal performance simulations to give sensible results. It is shown in this paper that on an hour-to-hour basis the stochastic component may be disregarded in building thermal, solar process heat and photovoltaic system performance without significantly affecting the results. Since the hourly stochastic component of the solar irradiation is very difficult to model, this result greatly simplifies the construction of synthetic climate data sets.},

Clouds are the dominant source of such variability and their velocity is a principal input to most short-term forecast and variability models. Two methods are presented to estimate cloud speed using measurements from eight global horizontal irradiance sensors at the UC San Diego Solar Energy test bed. The first method assigns the wind direction to the direction of the pair of sensors that exhibits the largest cross-correlation in the irradiance timeseries. This method is considered the ground truth. The second method requires only a sensor triplet; cloud speed and the angle of the cloud front are determined from the time delays in two cloud front arrivals at the sensors. Our analysis showed good agreement between both methods and nearby METAR and radiosonde observations. Both methods require high variability in the input radiation as provided only in partly cloudy skies.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last two decades, many photovoltaic (PV) systems have been connected to electricity distribution networks worldwide. Electricity utilities are often required to promote adaptations to their distribution systems in order to accommodate and to operate this kind of generators. This raises the issue of penetration limits for distributed PV generation. Airport buildings are typically large, isolated and free of shading, and they represent a great potential for the application of large scale PV systems. The energy demand patterns characterized by intensive utilization of air-conditioning, airport building energy demands correlates very good with solar generation profiles. For higher penetration ratios of distributed PV generation, to supply the energy levels demanded on airports, there are some concerns about voltage rise. Depending on the network configuration, severe problems might be faced, which would require costly grid structure upgrading. Also, protection schemes might eventually need adaptation to bidirectional power flows. The aim of this paper is to quantify the potential impact in the conventional distribution network where the airports are located. The results of the load flow analysis show that violations of the tolerated voltage rage only occur in worst-case scenario with zero load and maximal PV input.},

  Abstract                 = {{Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning : Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference , ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.}},

However, these conditions do not correspond to real operating conditions of Photovoltaics: In Freiburg, Germany, 50% of the total irradiation is in the interval below 600 W/m 2, but in Sudan, Africa, this amounts to 20% only. Module temperatures vary between - 20Â°C and 80Â°C, light incidence angles between 0 Â° and 90 Â°. As a consequence, the performance of PV modules under real conditions can be up to 30% (on a monthly scale) lower than at STC, depending on the weather and the module/cell design. Means to derive a rating of outdoor performance from indoor module measurements will be presented, and the variation of the module performance ratio with yearly or monthly irradiation sums and average temperatures is given. A linear correlation between performance ratio and the yearly average daytime temperature at a site is observed.},

  Abstract                 = {Inverter sizing strategies for grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems often do not take into account site-dependent peculiarities of ambient temperature, inverter operating temperature and solar irradiation distribution characteristics. The operating temperature affects PV modules and inverters in different ways and PV systems will hardly ever have a DC output equal to or above their STC-rated nominal power. Inverters are usually sized with a nominal AC output power some 30% (sometimes even more) below the PV array nominal power. In this paper, we show that this practice might lead to considerable energy losses, especially in the case of PV technologies with high temperature coefficients of power operating at sites with cold climates and of PV technologies with low temperature coefficients of power operating at sites with warm climates and an energy distribution of sunlight shifted to higher irradiation levels. In energy markets where PV kW h s are paid premium tariffs, like in Germany, energy yield optimization might result in a favorable payback of the extra capital invested in a larger inverter. This paper discusses how the time resolution of solar radiation data influences the correct sizing of PV plants. We demonstrate that using instant (10 s) irradiation values instead of average hourly irradiation values leads to considerable differences in optimum inverter sizing. When calculating inverter yearly efficiency values using both, hourly averages and 1-min averages, we can show that with increased time resolution of solar irradiation data there are higher calculated losses due to inverter undersizing. This reveals that hourly averages hide important irradiation peaks that need to be considered. We performed these calculations for data sets from pyranometer readings from Freiburg (48 N, Germany) and Florianopolis (27 S, Brazil) to further show the peculiarities of the site-dependent distribution of irradiation levels and its effects on inverter sizing.},

  Abstract                 = {Electricity power systems worldwide have traditionally been designed to a vertically connected scheme characterised by centralised generation. Over the last few decades, several factors have dictated a gradual shift from the central-control approach to a more distributed layout where distributed generation (DG) technologies are effectively integrated and not just connected (appended) to the networks; amongst others liberalisation of electricity markets, security and quality of supply and environmental issues. Photovoltaic powered distributed generation (PV-DG), although still having a much lesser impact than other DG technologies, is increasingly being embedded into electricity distribution networks worldwide within the framework of successful regulatory state and marketing programmes. PV-DG has added values (benefits) for the electricity systems that extend from peak power and load reduction (when deployed close to electricity consumption points) to participation in grid-supporting or grid-forming modes of operation. The question arises as to what the present situation of PV technology is for its optimal integration in distribution networks, whether there are still technical barriers to overcome as well as new opportunities for PV in future renewably supplied electricity systems. This paper presents the current state of knowledge concerning these topics from a European perspective with regard to different grid structures. It also discusses existing standards, new opportunities to provide grid services and research and development needs identified to fully exploit the added-valueâand still developingâbenefits of PV-DG.},

The aim of this paper is to contribute to a clarification of this issue. We propose here a derivation of the exergy of radiation, based solely on classical thermodynamics notions, making thus possible a ready check of the validity of the results. Results are given first for the blackbody case, then extended to a radiation with arbitrary spectrum. Finally, application of the notion of radiation entropy to a few simple examples shows the consistency of this notion with some well-known physical laws, and can even give some insight into the real signification of these laws.},

The usual description of the stochastic properties of wind speed independent of its direction is here criticized and an approach based on the coupled analysis of both wind speed and direction is proposed. Two stochastic models simulating three hourly wind speed and direction time series are investigated; encouraging results are obtained with a scheme combining a Markov chain model and a Discrete Auto Regressive Model of order 2 (DAR(2)). A comparison with 42 years of wind data measured at Brindisi airport, Italy, is made, showing that this compound model is able to generate direction and speed sequences that fairly agree, in the statistical sense, with the observed time series at the considered site.},

One of the tasks carried out in this project has been dedicated to forecast possible future scenarios of grid-connected photovoltaic buildings in Spain, considering technological, economic, social and environmental aspects. To perform the study, a methodology based in PV-scenarios has been developed. This methodology allows the researcher to establish future scenarios defined by a set of parameters that will determine the overall progress in grid-connected BIPV (building integrated photovoltaics). In order to facilitate the analysis, the ââScenariosPVââ software tool has been developed. This program has proved very useful to deal with PV parameters management, future scenarios analysis and detailed comparison. This methodology has been applied to estimate future PV-scenarios in Southern Spain. In an advanced scenario for the year 2020, the total grid-connected BIPV installed surface could reach 2,480,000m2, supplying as much as 1,872TJ per year, 10% of the electricity peak demand in the summertime and providing up to 25,000 jobs.},

  Title                    = {Empowering Variable Renewables: Options for Flexible Electricity Systems},
  Author                   = {Chandler, H.},
  Year                     = {2008},

  Abstract                 = {Increasing the share of renewables in energy portfolios is a key tool in the drive to reduce anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, as well as other harmful environmental impacts of conventional energy production, as illustrated in the recently released IEA publication, Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) 2008. A number of renewable electricity technologies, such as wind, wave, tidal, solar, and run-of-river hydro share a characteristic that distinguishes them from conventional power plants: their output varies according to the availability of the resource. This is commonly perceived to be challenging at high shares, but there is no intrinsic, technical ceiling to variable renewablesâ potential. Variability has to be looked at in the context of power system flexibility: if a power system is sufficiently flexible, in terms of power production, load management, interconnection and storage, the importance of the variability aspect is reduced. A flexible electricity system is one that can respond reliably, and rapidly, to large fluctuations in supply and demand. Flexibility is already present in all power systems, in order to manage fluctuations in demand, and it is crucial for high performance and economic and reliable operation. Consequently, low shares of variable renewables will present little additional impact in all but the least flexible (often the smallest) power systems. With large additions of supply-side variability, as fluctuations in output approach the scale of fluctuations in demand, additional measures must be taken to increase flexibility, in order to maintain reliability. The net variability in the combined output of many variable renewable electricity plants, based on different resources, at different locations over a wide area, is smoother than the output of individual power plants. This smoothing effect can be taken advantage of if the power plants are connected by adequate transmission capacity, and may reduce the need for additional system flexibility. The flexibility resource of any power system consists of a number of factors. On the supply side, chief among them are quickly dispatchable power plants, interconnection among adjacent power systems, and energy storage. However, a significant flexibility resource is also available on the demand side: changing the âshapeâ of demand to suit fluctuations in supply. This is as yet under-exploited. Both physical and market access to the flexibility resource are essential to increase the potential for variable renewables. In some countries, electricity is traded at shorter timescales relative to the traditional model of long-term bilateral contracts, through spot markets, and shorter gate closure times within such markets enable faster response to fluctuating supply and demand. An increasingly flexible approach to trading reduces the impact of forecast errors both in supply and demand, and increases access to the existing flexibility resource, reducing the need for additional fast response power plants, interconnection or storage. Much of existing transmission hardware in OECD countries was built in the middle of the last century, and a new investment cycle is due. This is a rare window of opportunity to improve on their design, bringing benefit not only to variable renewables but to the whole power system. This improvement can be made at three different levels: optimising the use of existing capacity, intelligent network operation, and new transmission technologies. Modification of transmission systems is likely to be a very slow process, and planning needs to begin urgently if potential for additional variable renewables uptake is to be exploited. The measures to increase flexibility proposed in this paper are available today, but careful cost/ benefit analysis is essential, and specific national and regional circumstances will influence the choice of option(s). Quantification of the associated costs of these measures, and resulting benefits in terms of variable renewable share, will be addressed in a further phase of work.},

This paper investigates the sensitivity of these high suctions to the presence of multiple surrounding building configurations. This study uses the Wind Engineering Research Field Laboratory (WERFL) building studied during the CSU/TTU Cooperative Program in Wind Engineering as a basic building shape. A model of the WERFL structure was constructed to a 1:50 scale and instrumented withmultiple pressure ports. Pressure taps on the 1:50 scale building model were connected to two 48-channel PSI transducer units. A large number of ââdummyââ models of similar dimensions were constructed to represent surrounding buildings. These model buildings were arranged in various symmetric configurations withdifferent separation distances, and placed in the Industrial Wind Tunnel of the Wind Engineering and Fluids Laboratory, Colorado State University. Measurements include mean, RMS and peak pressures, street canyon velocity profiles and laser-sheet flow visualizations. Shelter effects produced by the surrounding buildings on the central instrumented building were found to be significant, suchth at flow patterns are displaced and mean and peak induced loads are significantly different from the isolated building base case. The surface pressures of master WERFL model inside the urban street canyons were determined by the prognostic model FLUENT using the four differences closure approximation and FDS, large eddy simulations methodology. Calculations are compared against fluid modeling from wind-tunnel test.},

The assessment is carried out by considering the system-based point of view, on the basis of the measurements gathered at the interface between the PV plant and the grid or the supply point in the laboratory. New methodological hints on the formulation of the experimental tests are provided. The results of the waveform distortion analysis for harmonic currents and voltages are compared to the requirements of present power quality standards, indicating that in practical cases the current distortion can be significantly higher than in normal test conditions. Furthermore, the key aspect concerning harmonic and interharmonic modelling of multiple grid-connected PV inverters is addressed. Experimental results on plant configurations with multiple PV inverters show that low-order harmonics sum up almost arithmetically, whereas the higher-order harmonics and the interharmonics sum up in an almost Euclidean way.},

  Abstract                 = {The impact of photovoltaic (PV) generations, when added to an existing rural utility?s distribution system, is studied. The addition of PV is examined in the light of voltage support, loss reduction, and reduction in peak demand. Comparisons are made with the conventional and widely used methods for xoltage control and loss minimization, such as the addition of series and shunt capacitors and voltage regulators. The economics of distributed PV systems in the context of conventional grid power purchases are also studied. Results of this study are meant to be used as general guidelines for evaluating the impact of significant PV penetration in any distribution system.},

  Abstract                 = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

  Abstract                 = {Connections of distributed generation (DG) systems to distribution networks are increasing in number, though they may often be associated with the need of costly grid reinforcements or new control issues to maintain optimal operation. Appropriate analysis tools are required to check distribution networks operating conditions in the evolving scenario. Load flow (LF) calculations are typically needed to assess the allowed DG penetration level for a given network in order to ensure, for example, that voltage and current limits are not exceeded. The present paper deals with the solution of the LF problem in distribution networks with photovoltaic (PV) DG. Suitable models for prediction of the active power produced by PV DG units and the power absorbed by the loads are to be used to represent the uncertainty of solar energy availability and loads variation. The proposed models have been incorporated in a radial distribution probabilistic load flow (PLF) program that has been developed by using Monte Carlo techniques. The developed program allows probabilistic predictions of power flows at the various sections of distribution feeders and voltage profiles at all nodes of a network. After presenting theoretical concepts and software implementation, a practical case is also discussed to show the application of the study in order to assess the maximum PV peak power that can be installed into a distribution network without violating voltage and current constraints. A comparison between Deterministic Load Flow (DLF) and PLF analyses is also performed.},

  Abstract                 = {Statistical tools based on the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) are reviewed, and then applied to a dataset of aircraft observations of the atmospheric boundary layer from the tropical eastern Pacific, which includes quasi-stationary and non-stationary segments. The wavelet methods provide decompositions of variances and covariances, e.g. fluxes, between time scales that effectively describe a broadband process like atmospheric turbulence. Easily understood statistical confidence bounds are discussed and applied to these scale decompositions, and results are compared to Fourier methods for quasi-stationary turbulence. The least asymmetric LA(8) wavelet filter yields coefficients that exhibit better uncorrelatedness across scales than the Haar filter and is better suited for decomposition of broadband turbulent signals. An application to a non-stationary segment of our dataset, namely vertical profiles of the turbulent dissipation rate, highlights the flexibility of wavelet methods. },

  Abstract                 = {Solar photovoltaic energy has been, for many years now, a promising alternative in the diversification of global energetic sources. Although photovoltaic energy has many advantages, it has not yet become commercially popular, because it is still an expensive alternative. In fact, studies have already shown that the investment in such systems are paid back, but it is still hard to find people willing to wait five or six years to have their money back. The aim of this work is to reduce the payback time of photovoltaic stand-alone pumping systems, optimizing not only the efficiency of the photovoltaic conversion, using a maximum power point tracking algorithm, but also minimizing the losses in the induction motor. Based on the design procedures described in this paper, a prototype has been developed and experimental results with the optimizing strategy are shown.},

  Abstract                 = {As output from photovoltaic (PV) panels is closely related to sunlight levels, monitoring solar irradiance levels is crucial for system design and predictive purposes. With advances in PV technology, urban sites at northerly locations, where both horizontal and vertical solar irradiance make significant contributions, are becoming increasingly important. The aim of this paper is to compare solar irradiance for horizontal and vertical orientations and to assess the relative effectiveness of differing averages, from 10 min to 1 h, for use in short-term prediction of solar irradiance levels for a UK site. Vertical and horizontal solar irradiance observations were collected from a monitoring station on the roof of a five-storey building at an urban site in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK (latitude 558N). 10-min data was collected for 13- or 15-day periods in two summers (1994, 1995) and two winters (1993, 1994). Although mean levels for horizontal and vertical irradiance were different, as expected, general patterns were very similar indicating the possibility of predicting vertical irradiance from horizontal at the same location. 10-min, 20-min, 30-min and 1-h averaging times were compared utilising autocorrelation coefficients and ARIMA models to assess the information lost when using longer averaging intervals. For consideration of short-term changes, 10-min averages were most informative whilst hourly averages were substantially poorer.},

  Abstract                 = {Sunshine levels incident in the plane of a photovoltaic panel are the overriding influence on electrical output, and modelling solar irradiance is therefore an essential step in the design and performance prediction of solar energy conversion systems. This study aims to assess the eÂcacy of SARIMA models and their potential for short-term prediction at a northerly latitude. Data was collected from a monitoring site on the roof of a 5-storey building at a city centre location in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK (latitude 558N). Hourly and ten minute data relating to 13 and 15 day periods in two winters (1993, 1994) and two summers (1994, 1995) were utilised. Univariate stochastic modelling, using SARIMA models, is carried out for horizontal and south facing vertical solar irradiance. Results showed that these models provided a good fit for the ten minute averaged horizontal and vertical irradiance, with, on average, 82% and 85% of total variation being accounted for respectively. Use of hourly averaged data in these models gave a substantial reduction in the fit. Models for the winter data were a poorer fit than for summer for both orientations. It is concluded that the SARIMA approach can be used to develop prediction methods and to study rapid and large changes in PV output from extensive areas of solar cladding.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work, we examine some of the limits to large-scale deployment of solar photovoltaics (PV) in traditional electric power systems. Specifically, we evaluate the ability of PV to provide a large fraction (up to 50%) of a utility systemâs energy by comparing hourly output of a simulated large PV system to the amount of electricity actually usable. The simulations use hourly recorded solar insolation and load data for Texas in the year 2000 and consider the constraints of traditional electricity generation plants to reduce output and accommodate intermittent PV generation. We find that under high penetration levels and existing grid-operation procedures and rules, the system will have excess PV generation during certain periods of the year. Several metrics are developed to examine this excess PV generation and resulting costs as a function of PV penetration at different levels of system flexibility. The limited flexibility of base load generators produces increasingly large amounts of unusable PV generation when PV provides perhaps 10â20% of a systemâs energy. Measures to increase PV penetration beyond this range will be discussed and quantified in a follow-up analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {The typical design of photovoltaic facilities with photovoltaic solar trackers is achieved using a squared or diagonal distribution of the trackers. In general, this is a good distribution for harvesting most solar radiation. However, these facilities can be affected by shadows of environmental objects like buildings, vegetation, etc. In this paper, a metaheuristic method based on evolution strategies is presented for calculating the best location of each tracker on a building of irregular shape, considering the shadows caused by obstacles and photovoltaic trackers. The evolution strategies will use the energy readings obtained by a photovoltaic tracker distribution to look for the best location. In the calculus of the energy, solar charts are used to combine the solar radiation received and shadows suffered by the tracker for each solar position.},

  Abstract                 = {Wavelet analysis has been formalized extensively due to the efforts of mathematicians, physicists and engineers in the last two decades. It has generated a tremendous interest in these communities both in theoretical and applied areas, in such a way that wavelet analysis is also considered now as a nucleus of shared aspirations and ideas. Initially applied to seismic signal studies in geophysics in the 1980s, wavelet techniques have been explored in the atmospheric sciences since the pioneer applications in turbulence studies. If one decides to apply the wavelet analysis to a given signal, it is worthwhile to assess the actual need of the technique itself and the best way to perform it. In atmospheric signal applications, two main directions have been followed: the singularity and the variance analysis. In this paper, the potential uses of this tool supported by some recently published works in the field of atmospheric sciences are discussed. Therefore, initially the characteristics and main properties of the wavelet analysis are presented, focusing on those that are mostly used in the analysis of atmospheric signals. Continuous and discrete wavelet transforms are also discussed, as well as the scalograms and the variance analysis. Finally, some examples of wavelet analysis applied to a wide range of atmospheric science phenomena are presented. (c) 2005 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It is shown that both the RBF and MLP models performed well based on the root-mean-square error between the observed and estimated solar radiations. However, the RBF models are preferred since they require less computing power. The RBF model, obtained by training with data from the meteorological stations at Masirah, Salalah, Seeb, Sur, Fahud and Sohar, and testing with those from Buraimi and Marmul, was the best.

Examples for this type of information for Germany are the annual and monthly irradiation maps as published by the German Weather Service (DWD), the data bank of hourly irradiance data with continuous spatial coverage prepared by the University of Oldenburg, and the irradiation data products of the Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CMSAF) assembled by a consortium of European Weather Services. To assess the validity of these data sets for the aforementioned tasks, a case study is performed for the region of the German federal state of Saxony using data for the year 2005. For this region a set of ground-measured irradiance data from meteorological stations operated by the German Weather Service (DWD) is available. The comparison of hourly irradiance information is done by the monthly analysis of the bias and the RMS-error for the Oldenburg data bank of hourly values versus the ground station data. For an additional intercomparison of the different data sources, the annual maps presenting the estimated irradiation sums for 2005 are analyzed. This gives information on data accuracy with respect to the spatial structure of the irradiation field. The assessment of the end use accuracy of the irradiation data is made by investigating a set of monthly energy yield data of gridconnected PV systems. This is done via the estimation of the energy yield using a PV system simulation applying the irradiation data generated at the University of Oldenburg.},

  Abstract                 = {Small grid-connected photovoltaic systems up to 5 kWp are often not monitored because advanced surveillance systems are not economical. Hence, some system failures which lead to partial energy losses stay unnoticed for a long time. Even a failure that results in a larger energy deficit can be difficult to detect by PV laymen due to the fluctuating energy yields. Within the EU project PVSAT-2, a fully automated performance check has been developed to assure maximum energy yields and to optimize system maintenance for small grid-connected PV systems. The aim is the early detection of system malfunctions and changing operating conditions to prevent energy and subsequent financial losses for the operator. The developed procedure is based on satellitederived solar irradiance information that replaces on-site measurements. In conjunction with a simulation model the expected energy yield of a PV system is calculated. In case of the occurrence of a defined difference between the simulated and actual energy yield, an automated failure detection routine searches for the most probable failure sources and notifies the operator. This paper describes the individual components of the developed procedureâthe satellite-derived irradiance, the used PV simulation model, and the principles of the automated failure detection routine. Moreover, it presents results of an 8-months test phase with 100 PV systems in three European countries.},

  Abstract                 = {Long series of hourly mean wind speeds and the maximum hourly 3-s gust are simulated for four sites in the British Isles in order to investigate methods for the determination of extreme wind speed events. The simulation is performed using a one-step Markov chain model. First, the observations are used to generate series of the same length as the real time series. It is found that the synthetic series reproduce well the means, standard deviations, and maximum and minimum wind speeds of the observed scales. As expected, they are less successful at reproducing the observation autocorrelation properties with the lagged correlation coefficients decaying two rapidly in the simulated series. The method is then used to generate synthetic series of 10, 50, 100, 1000, and 10 000 years in length. In a modified form of Monte Carlo analysis, each run of the Markov model is repeated 1000 times. The maximum wind speed from each run is extracted, and the mean of the 1000 values is taken to be the extreme wind speed for a return period equal to the length of the simulation. The results are compared with extreme wind speed calculated from conventional extreme event analysis. It is hypothesized that over the shorter return period (10 and 50 years) the comparison amounts to a validation since the conventional analysis may be expected to produce a reliable estimate of the true extreme. The authors find relatively close agreement between the extremes predicted by the two techniques at these shorter return periods. At the longer return periods (1000 and 10 000 years in length), the predictions from the synthetic time series are generally lower than those obtained from conventional analysis techniques. It is suggested that the results from the Markov model may be more realistic since one would expect them to be some theoretical maximum to wind speeds at any location imposed by atmospheric circulation characteristics.},

A variety of numerical and analytic models for calculating the LLP are described and evaluated using data for three Spanish locations.

It is concluded that numerical models are accurate but complex to use, while analytic models exhibit significant lack of accuracy. A new analytic model, as accurate as the numerical models and as simple as analytic models, is proposed. For each location, the model requires as input 4 different coefficients.},

  Abstract                 = {In the context of a safe and environment-friendly energy supply renewable energy systems will be the energy source of the future. Wind energy has become an important energy source in Europe (e.g. 15 % in Denmark) with an impressive expansion rate. The usage of solar energy will experience an enormous increase within the next 10 years as well. For the optimal and efficient use of solar energy and its integration into the electricity grid, accurate solar irradiance data in a high spatial and temporal resolution are necessary. Solar irradiance schemes provide these data based on weather satellites such as Meteosat or MSG. A successful integration of solar energy technologies into the existing energy structure highly depends on a detailed knowledge of the solar resource. HELIOSAT-3 will supply high quality solar radiation data gained from the exploitation of existing Earth observation technologies and will take advantage of the enhanced capabilities of the new Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) meteorological satellites. The expected quality represents a substantial improvement with respect to the available methods and will better match the needs of the users of the resulting products. In particular, HELIOSAT-3 will provide .. solar irradiance data with high accuracy and spacetime resolution necessary for solar energy applications, plus a large geographical coverage .. additional solar energy specific data (direct and spectral irradiance, angular distribution of diffuse irradiance, spatial structure of irradiance) according to the needs of end-users .. information on HELIOSAT-3 products, its sustainability as a service and its potential benefits to end-users. The objectives of the HELIOSAT-3 project will be achieved by the development and establishment of a new type of solar irradiance calculation schemes (see chapter 3). This scheme will be based on satellite retrieved atmospheric data (see chapter 2)},

  Abstract                 = {As a result of the application of deregulation in the electric power sector, a new identity appeared in the electric power system map known as âdistributed generationâ (DG). According to new technology, the electric power generation trend uses disbursed generator sized from kW to MW at load sits instead of using traditional centralized generation units sized from 100MW to GW and located far from the loads where the natural recourses are available. This paper introduces a survey of this revolutionary approach of DGs, which will change the way electric power systems operate along with their types and operating technologies. Some important definitions of DGs and their operational constraints are discussed to help in understanding the concepts and regulations related to DGs. Furthermore, we will survey the operational and economical benefits of implementing DGs in the distribution network. Most DG literatures are based on studying the definitions, constructions or benefits of DGs separately. However, in our paper we aim to give a comprehensive survey by adding new classifications to relate the DG types, technologies and applications to each other.},

The recent situation is that a lot of environmental situations which can occur with a relative high probability are not defined normative. Environmental conditions in the case of different short-circuits in the grid and induced values in the case of lightning-surge impacts were examined. Further special test-series at inverters of different technologies and for different applications (stand-alone and grid-connected) were performed at the special test-stand in Vienna with the ability of generator and net-simulation and the high-voltage and high-current test-laboratory to simulate environmental conditions with extreme parameters. The aim of the tests was to develop suitable measurements against disturbances and dangers (risks) and to get a base for new test-parameters for PV inverters},

Highlights like the German 100,000-Roofs-Solar-Programme, PV programmes at schools financed by utilities and governments (e.g. âSONNEonlineâ by PreussenElektra, âSonne in der Schuleâ by BMWi and âSonne in der Schuleâ by Bayernwerk) and large centralised installations of MW size (âNeue Messe MuÂ?nchenâ by Bayernwerk and âEnergiepark Mont-Cenisâ by state Nordrhein-Westfalen, Stadtwerke Herne and European Union) count for the potential of grid-connected PV. Today in Germany a typical grid-connected PV installation of 1 kW nominal power produces average annual energy yields of 700 kWh (dependent on location and system components) and shows a high operating availability. The price per kWh from PV installations is still significantly higher than the price for conventional energy, but new funding schemes and cost models (like the large increase of feed-in tariff in Germany due to the Act on Granting Priority to Renewable Energy Sources in 2000) give optimism about the future.},

  Abstract                 = {A significant proportion of the total national energy budget of european countries is spent in buildings, therefore the efforts addressed to optimize buildingâs thermal behaviour are of vital importance. In this sense, facades play a fundamental role. They act not only as barriers between external and internal conditions, but they can also help to reduce the consumption of energy for heating, ventilation and air conditioning. Moreover, they can help to produce healthy and comfortable indoor conditions. The use of large, transparent areas in facades is a common current practice. Despite the architectural interest of these glazed areas, in Mediterranean climatic conditions they are responsible for building overheating. In these zones, double-skin envelopes made up of two layers of glass separated by an air channel -to collect or evacuate the solar energy absorbed by the facade- are considered to be a design option that could resolve this issue. In other climatic conditions, large heat losses may constitute the most determinant factor. The objectives of this thesis are to give a step forward in the study and numerical analysis of passive systems in general, and advanced facades in particular. A transient code for the simulation of double and single skin facades including advanced technological elements, like phase change materials, transparent insulation and facade integrated collectors-accumulators has been developed. The features of the physic and mathematical models implemented are described. Instantaneous or integrated performance parameters describing thermal behaviour of the facades are defined. The numerical models implemented within the numerical tool have been submitted to a validation process in different forms: by comparing the numerical resultswith those obtained for simplified situations with analytical solutions, with tabulated global performance coefficients of simple facade configurations and with the results of other building simulation codes. Experimental research has been carried out in test cells situated at different geographical locations, thus they were subject to different climatic conditions. The main objective of the numerical code developed is to simulate advanced facades in order to assess the long termperformance, and to account with a virtual tool to test passive designs, including challenging innovations. The applications of the numerical tool described in this thesis, for the optimisation of facades of real buildings are presented. As future actions, the link of the onedimensional simulations produced by this numerical tool with a multi-dimensional simulation of specific zones of the facades is foreseen.},

  Abstract                 = {A practical method for operating an inverter-fed induction motor drive at the point of maximum efficiency while maintaining any particular torque-speed load point is presented. The design and operation of an economical, microprocessor-based adaptive controller used to modify a commercially available six-step inverter for minimum loss operation of an induction motor are described. Experimental results are presented in graphical form, giving comparison of overall drive system efficiencies between loss minimization control and constant volts/hertz control operation for a standard-efficiency induction motor with a 10 hp rating. The greatest potential for energy savings is found to exist for the case of loads with nonlinear torque-speed characteristics, such as a fan or pump load},

  Abstract                 = {Turbulence â in terms of standard deviation of wind speed fluctuations â and other flow characteristics are different in the interior of wind farms relative to the ambient flow and action must be taken to ensure sufficient structural sustainability of the wind turbines exposed to âwind farm flowâ. The standard deviation of wind speed fluctuations is a known key parameter for both extreme- and fatigue loading, and it is argued and found to be justified that a model for change in turbulence intensity alone may account for increased fatigue loading in wind farms. Changes in scale of turbulence and horizontal flow-shear also influence the dynamic response and thus fatigue loading. However, these parameters are typically â negatively or positively â correlated with the standard deviation of wind speed fluctuations, which therefore can, if need be, represent these other variables. Thus, models for spatially averaged turbulence intensity inside the wind farm and direct-wake turbulence intensity are being devised and a method to combine the different load situations is proposed. The combination of the load cases implies a weighting method involving the slope of the considered materialâs Wöhler curve. In the context, this is novel and necessary to avoid excessive safety for fatigue estimation of the structureâs steel components, and non-conservatism for fibreglass components. The proposed model offers significant reductions in computational efforts in the design process. The status for the implementation of the model is that it became part of the Danish standard for wind turbine design DS 472 (2001) in August 2001 and it is part of the corresponding international standard, IEC61400-1 (2005). Also, extreme loading under normal operation for wake conditions and the efficiency of very large wind farms are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems in buildings shows several advantages compared to conventional PV power plants. The main objectives of the present study are the quantitative evaluation of the beneÂ®ts of building-integrated PV systems over their entire life-cycle and the identiÂ®cation of best solutions to maximize their energy eÂciency and CO2 mitigation potential. In order to achieve these objectives, a simpliÂ®ed life-cycle analysis (LCA) has been carried out. Firstly, a number of existing applications have been studied. Secondly, a parametric analysis of possible improvements in the balance-of-system (BOS) has been developed. Finally, the two steps have been combined with the analysis of crystalline silicon technologies. Results are reported in terms of several indicators: energy pay-back time, CO2 yield and speciÂ®c CO2 emissions. The indicators show that the integration of PV systems in buildings clearly increases the environmental beneÂ®ts of present PV technology. These beneÂ®ts will further increase with future PV technologies. Future optimized PV roof-integrated systems are expected to have an energy pay-back time of around 1.5 years (1 year with heat recovery) and to save during their lifetime more than 20 times the amount of CO2 emitted during their manufacturing (34 times with heat recovery).},

The analysis of this work is the basis for further improvements of each of the modelling approaches and thus enables a reduction of the prediction error in PV yield estimations. The recently completed first of three planned round-robin inter-comparisons found that the agreement for all methods and all technologies is within 5% on an annual basis, provided that the environmental parameters incident irradiance and the module temperature are well described. This good accuracy was also found when translating the energy yield measured at one location in Europe to another for an identical module utilising shorter time periods (months). Significantly higher errors were found when using different PV modules of the same manufacturer and technology to predict the energy yield at other sites. Here the variation in module power rating dominated the results of the energy prediction methods and a correction for these differences had to be applied.},

Five simple algebraic methods addressed to predict this behaviour in Mediterranean climates have been empirically validated. Firstly, the calibration in STC of all significant electrical parameters of both a monocrystalline and a polycrystalline silicon PV modules was entrusted to an accredited independent laboratory. Then, a 12-month test and measurement campaign carried out on these modules in the city of JaeÂ?n (Spain, latitude 38 N, longitude 3 W) has provided the necessary experimental data. Results show that (a) crystalline silicon PV module outdoors performance may be described with sufficient accuracy â for PV engineering purposes â only taking into account incident global irradiance, cell temperature, and using any one of two simple algebraic methods tried in this paper and (b) regardless the used method, poor results may be achieved if the PV specimens under study are not electrically characterised in STC prior to analysing their outdoors performance. Even so, the methods recommended in (a) perform best.},

  Abstract                 = {Simulation studies of solar energy systems have traditionally been performed using hourly data because data for shorter time periods are generally unavailable for extended periods. If simulations using hourly data are to provide accurate results, the variation of radiation within an hour must have a negligible effect on a systemâs performance. This paper examines minute radiation data from three locations. The distribution of minute data within the hour is found to differ from previously presented distributions of daily radiation in a month. Comparisons of calculated and measured minute radiation on a tilted surface show significant differences which are attributable to inaccurate estimates of the magnitude and distribution of diffuse radiation on a minute basis. Even with the same tilted surface radiation, significant differences in simulated performance using. hourlv and minute-by-minute data are found to exist for a I I simple photovoltaic system.},

  Abstract                 = {When analysing the influence of shade on photovoltaic (PV) systems, the intuitive assumption is that conversion architectures with more inverters, such as string- and module-inverters, will have lower energy losses associated with partial shading of the generators. However, other phenomena which can affect a systemâs response to shade, for example, the way in which the inverter performs the maximum power point tracking (MPPT), mean that modular configurations are not always the least susceptible to shade effects. We present a case in which the general tendency of many of the currently available commercial inverters to remain in local power maxima results in a string-inverter configuration behaving worse in response to shade than a central-inverter configuration. Experimental data were collected throughout 2005 and 2006 from PV plants in Arguedas and Sesma (Spain). We interpret our observations with theoretical analysis based on the results of simulation experiments.},

The first model represents wind forces acting on the antenna dish, and it closely represents actual wind action. The second model represents wind gusts as torque disturbances applied to the antenna drives. The third model represents gusts acting at the antenna rate input. A wind filter introduced in this article makes the wind gusts of the third model equivalent to the gusts of the second model. The third model is of recent interest, since it is applicable to the currently developed models of the antenna closed-loop systems. Simulink models of the 34-m and 70-m antennasâ closed-loop systems were developed to simulate antenna servo errors in wind gusts. The article shows that for the 34-m and 70-m antennas all three models give similar results, and that the results are comparable to the field measurements of the servo errors taken in wind.},

  Abstract                 = {Wind data measured during a Â¯eld experiment were used to verify the analytical model of wind gusts. Good coincidence was observed; the only discrepancy occurred for the azimuth error in the front and back winds, where the simulated errors were smaller than the measured ones. This happened because of the assumption of the spatial coherence of the wind gust model, which generated a symmetric antenna load and, in consequence, a low azimuth servo error. This result indicates a need for upgrading the wind gust model to a spatially incoherent one that will reÂ°ect the real gusts in a more accurate manner. In order to design a controller with wind disturbance rejection properties, the wind disturbance should be known at the input to the antenna rate loop model. The second task, therefore, consists of developing a digital Â¯lter that simulates the wind gusts at the antenna rate input. This Â¯lter matches the spectrum of the measured servo errors. In this scenario, the wind gusts are generated by introducing white noise to the ¯lter input.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a data-driven approach for estimating the degree of variability and predictability associated with large-scale wind energy production for a planned integration in a given geographical area, with an application to The Netherlands. A new method is presented for generating realistic time series of aggregated wind power realizations and forecasts. To this end, simultaneous wind speed time series?-?both actual and predicted?-?at planned wind farm locations are needed, but not always available. A 1-year data set of 10-min averaged wind speeds measured at several weather stations is used. The measurements are first transformed from sensor height to hub height, then spatially interpolated using multivariate normal theory, and finally averaged over the market resolution time interval. Day-ahead wind speed forecast time series are created from the atmospheric model HiRLAM (High Resolution Limited Area Model). Actual and forecasted wind speeds are passed through multi-turbine power curves and summed up to create time series of actual and forecasted wind power. Two insights are derived from the developed data set: the degree of long-term variability and the degree of predictability when Dutch wind energy production is aggregated at the national or at the market participant level. For a 7.8?GW installed wind power scenario, at the system level, the imbalance energy requirements due to wind variations across 15-min intervals are ±14% of the total installed capacity, while the imbalance due to forecast errors vary between 53% for down- and 56% for up-regulation. When aggregating at the market participant level, the balancing energy requirements are 2-3% higher. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Solar energy collected at a number of discrete sites, which are dispersed over a geographical area, will exhibit both spatial and temporal variability. Being able to model this variability will have many applications, for example in controlling an electricity system that is supplied by decentralised PV arrays. This paper describes a statistical modelling study of solar data that were recorded over 2 years at a total of 22 sites in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland, and in the nearby Pentland hills. A spatio-temporal model is proposed for global irradiation on a horizontal plane: this incorporates the sum of two exponentials to model the decrease in covariance between sites with time lag, and a space–time term to model the combined dependence of covariance on time lag and easterly distance.},

This paper considers the use of matching pursuit for computing signal expansions in terms of damped sinusoids. First, expansion based on complex damped sinusoids is explored; it is shown that the expansion can be efficiently derived using the FFT and simple recursive filterbanks. Then, the approach is extended to provide decompositions in terms of real damped sinusoids. This extension relies on generalizing the matching pursuit algorithm to derive expansions with respect to dictionary subspaces; of specific interest is the subspace spanned by a complex atom and its conjugate. Developing this particular case leads to a framework for deriving real-valued expansions of real signals using complex atoms. Applications of the damped sinusoidal decomposition include system identification, spectral estimation, and signal modeling for coding and analysis-modification-synthesis},

  Abstract                 = {Wind tunnel experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of wind velocity and airborne dust concentration on the drop of photovoltaic ({PV}) cell performance caused by dust accumulation on such cells. Performance drop was investigated at four wind velocities and four dust concentrations. I-V characteristics were determined for various intensities of cell pollution. The evolutions of the short circuit current, the open circuit voltage, the maximum power, the reduction of solar intensity received by the cells, and the fill factor variation with increasing cell pollution were examined. The deposition (and accumulation) of fine aeolian dust on PV cells significantly affects the performance of such cells. Wind velocity has an important impact on cell performance drop, since the drop is larger in high winds than in low winds. However, the wind also affects the sedimentological structure of the dust coating on the cell, resulting in a higher transmittance (of light) for coatings created during high winds. The wind tunnel experiments indicate that the former effect is more important than the latter, which means that, in general, the drop in PV cell performance due to dust accumulation is larger as wind speed increases. Airborne dust concentration also affects the drop in PV cell performance, since high dust concentrations lead to a higher accumulation on the cell. Contrary to wind speed, airborne dust concentration does not seem to affect the sedimentological structure of dust coatings (with respect to light transmittance) on PV cells.},

Accumulation was measured with marble collectors every month. At the same time, wind speed, dust concentration, dew formation and rainfall were recorded. Atmospheric stability was measured from a 90 m tower several km from the test site. Dust accumulation by day was systematically higher than dust accumulation at night. Also, dust concentration was higher, but the higher concentrations cannot completely explain die higher accumulation values. Both average monthly concentration and accumulation are considerably influenced by the occurrence of high-magnitude dust events, either dust storms or dust hazes. The dust that accumulated at night was systematically coarser than the dust that accumulated during the day. No seasonal trend was observed in the grain size of the sediment. The velocity of accumulation, defined as the ratio between accumulation and concentration, varied between 1·18 m.s-1 and 4·53 m.s-1. Dew formation did not seem to have a serious impact upon dust accumulation, whereas wind erosion, and especially the erosion occurring during heavy gusts, appears to play a very important role, since these gusts may be able to blow away large amounts of sediment that accumulated during the preceding hours, days or even weeks.},

Applicability of the clearness-index (K) and sunshine fraction (S/So) models for diffuse estimation and the effect of combining several variables into a single multilinear equation are tested. Correlations connecting the diffuse to global fraction (HdIH) with K and S/So predict Hd values more accurately than their separate use. Among clearness-index and sunshine-fraction models, S/So models are found to have better accuracy if correlations are developed for wide latitude ranges. By including a term for declinations in the correlation, the accuracy of the estimated data can be marginally improved. The addition of latitude to the equation does not help to improve the accuracy further.},

They also incorporate appropriate functional forms that ensure accurate results for photovoltaic system design and, in particular, for systems with buyback thresholds. Both beam and diffuse shading are treated properly and diffuse shading is found to represent a 2%-6% loss that has systematically been ignored in past studies. Sample sensitivity studies illustrate evaluation of the energetic advantage of tracking vs. stationary deployment and its significant dependence on ground cover ratio. The impact of isotropic versus anisotropic modeling of diffuse radiation is quantified and shown to give rise to non-negligible differences (up to 10%) in yearly collectible energy. We also determine an optimal tracking strategy for two-axis trackers which, however, is found to yield a 0%-2% energetic advantage relative to conventional normal-incidence tracking.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate design and optimization of short response time solar energy systems with storage are sensitive to the stationary and sequential characteristics of hourly solar radiation. We perform monthly time series analyses of hourly global horizontal solar radiation for a wide range of climatic stations that span temperate and tropical conditions. The stationary statistics for individual hours are found to be very similar to the corresponding results for daily total global horizontal radiation, in keeping with a related fundamental observation of Liu \& Jordan. Investigation of sequential properties shows that autocorrelation coefficients are, to a good approximation, independent of time of day and that persistence times are nearly as long as the entire daylight period, mainly due to the effect of very strong correlations at one-hour lag times. The isolated effect of two-hour and longer lag times, via the partial autocorrelation coefficients, is found to be negligible in most, but by no means all, instances. Finally, we find no universal correlation between hourly autocorrelation coefficients and monthly average radiation figures},

  Abstract                 = {The optimal design of central-station photovoltaic (PV) systems depends, among other factors, on the field layout of PV arrays, PV array geometry, tracking constraints, and intermodule electrical connections. We illustrate the sensitivity of yearly PV system energy delivery losses that stem from inter-array shading as a function of key field, tracker, and array-related variables for flat-plates. The results turn out, to an excellent approximation, to be independent of site. We quantitatively assess the magnitude of series/ parallel module connections, and bypass diode placement within arrays, on energy losses attributable to inter-array shading. The sensitivity to key design parameters is also found to be predicted accurately by calculations of collectible energy only. As such, the calculations are of general value for rapid yet accurate PV system analysis and optimization.},

The simulation was required to model load curves for each household, as well as for commercial enterprises in the village. The time resolution for the ultimate load curve for the model is 5 min. The next step assumed photovoltaic plants on the roofs of buildings, taking building size into account. The plant capacities were varied in four scenarios. For the run of the irradiation we used a summer day with maximal irradiation. With the assistance of a load flow program we calculated the voltages of every nodes in the low and medium high voltage network, the observance of the permissible currents and the balance of losses. In scenarios using a major part of the suitable roof areas voltage excess the limits in some branches of the low voltage network (Unomirml+10%). Voltages were always within the tolerance range in the medium high voltage network. Improvements can be realised by strengthening the lines, optimal adjustment of low voltage transformers and regulation of the medium voltage transformers based on active power.},

  Abstract                 = {Perhaps the greatest obstacle to large-scale solar energy generation is the intermittent nature of solar energy and the associated costly storage. This paper presents a method to optimize combinations of selected worldwide regions in different time zones with the surprising capability of providing sufficient electricity generation to overcome intermittency or reduce it to such an extent that substantially less storage and generation capacity are needed. The recent sharp drop in the cost of photovoltaic (PV) generation capability accompanied by worldwide increased investment in PV plants suggests a new economic base for cooperative efforts to sequentially combine day time insolation. The approach presented here optimizes two aspects, first, the selection of sites across large geographic areas, and second, the size and relative proportion of generation and storage capacity at each site. Our approach converts 20 years of daily insolation data by NASA Solar Sizer to hourly scale. The hourly data are used to assess and compare supranational distributed solar networks in different parts of the globe that have recently been proposed, and to subsequently optimize their generation capacity and storage. We show that linking regions in different time zones and on the two hemispheres can fully eliminate intermittency without the need for fuel and renewable energy other than solar.},

  Abstract                 = {The relative weight of the energy generated by means of renewable sources is constantly increasing. Among all these sources, the photovoltaic (PV) systems present the higher and more stable relative growth. However, the PV system is still too expensive and a significant effort is being done to increase the efficiency and reduce the cost. Concerning the PV inverters, this has lead to the elimination of the low frequency (LF) transformer that has been traditionally included. The LF transformer provides isolation from the grid but reduces the PV inverter efficiency and increases its size and cost. However, the elimination of the transformer might generate strong ground currents, which become now an important design parameter for the PV inverter. The ground currents are a function of the system stray elements. However, there is no simple model and procedure to study the common mode behavior of a PV system, which is required to analyze the ground currents. In this paper, a comprehensible model is proposed which provides a better understanding of the common mode issue in single-phase transformerless PV systems. In addition, a procedure is developed to analyze the global performance, efficiency, grid current quality, and common mode behavior of a PV inverter as a function of its particular structure and modulation technique},

  Abstract                 = {The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is responding to a growing demand for high-accuracy solar resource data with uncertainties significantly lower than those of existing solar resource datasets, such as the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). Measurements for long-term solar resource characterizations require years to complete, which is an unacceptable timeline for the rapidly emerging needs of renewable energy applications. This contribution seeks methods of reducing the uncertainty of existing long-term solar resource datasets by incorporating lower-uncertainty site-specific ground measurements of a limited period of record. In particular, various techniques are being explored to make full use of the existing high-resolution radiation data available in the NSRDB and other sources, and extrapolate them over time using locally measured data and other supportive information. The interannual variability in global and direct radiation is studied here using long-term data at various sites. NSRDB‚Äôs modeled data for the 1998‚Äì2005 period are compared to quality-controlled measurements to assess the performance of the model, which is found to vary greatly depending on climatic condition. The reported results are encouraging for applications involving concentrators at very sunny sites. Large seasonal biases are found at some cloudy sites. Various improvements are proposed to enhance the quality of the existing model and modeled data. The measurement of solar radiation to characterize the solar climate for renewable energy and other applications is a time consuming and expensive operation. Full climate characterization may require several decades of measurements‚Äîa prospect that is not practical for an industry intent on rapid deployment of solar technologies. This study demonstrates that the consistency of the solar resource in both time and space varies widely across the United States. The mapped results here illustrate regions with high and low variability and provide readers with quick visual information to help them decide where and how long measurements should be taken for a particular application. The underlying data that form these maps are also available from NREL to provide users the opportunity for more detailed analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {HTA Burgdorfâs PV laboratory has carried out many tests with small grid-connected PV-inverters since 1989. In spring 1994, a new test centre for PV-systems with a PV generator of 60 kWp became operational. With this test centre, tests of medium sized inverters up to 30kW are also possible. A significant extension of the testing facilities was possible with the introduction of solar generator simulators. Several PV generator simulators up to 25kW with high stability were developed in 1998 to 2000 (one of them computer controlled). With these simulators, partly automatic inverter tests can now be carried out much faster. In this paper at first a short overview of the concepts used in grid connected PV inverters is given. Then the most important test results of all inverters tested (more than 28) will be displayed, which clearly shows the considerable progress achieved in the last years. The evolution of different important properties of PV inverters will also be discussed. Results of intense tests of some recently developed inverters used in many grid connected PV-systems will be used to illustrate some interesting cases or typical performance of new inverters. Reliability of inverters will considered using monitoring data of more than 45 PV plants continuously monitored since 1992},

As the solar surface irradiance can be inferred from satellite measurements with a high temporal and spatial resolution, we use satellite images as a data source for forecasting. The satellite data provide information on cloudiness, the most important atmospheric parameter for surface irradiance. This paper describes the application of a statistical method to detect the motion of cloud structures from satellite images. Extrapolating the temporal development of the cloud situation, solar radiation can be predicted for time scales from 30 min up to 2 h. The forecasts are evaluated with respect to accuracy and an example for the application of the forecast algorithm to predict PV power output is presented.},

To some, this means that transformer technology is a fully mature and staid industry, with little opportunity for innovation or ingenuity by those practicing in the field. Of course, we in the industry find that premise to be erroneous. One need only scan the technical literature to recognize that leading-edge suppliers, users, and academics involved with power transformers are continually reporting novelties and advancements that would have been totally insensible to engineers of even the recent past. I contend that there are three basic levels of understanding, any of which may be appropriate for persons engaged with transformers in the electric power industry. Depending on dayto- day involvement, the individualâs posture in the field can be described as: â¢ Curious â those with only peripheral involvement with transformers, or a nonprofessional lacking relevant academic background or any particular need to delve into the intricacies of the science â¢ Professional â an engineer or senior-level technical person who has made a career around electric power transformers, probably including other heavy electric-power apparatus and the associated power-system transmission and distribution operations â¢ Expert â those highly trained in the field (either practically or analytically) to the extent that they are recognized in the industry as experts. These are the people who are studying and publishing the innovations that continue to prove that the field is nowhere near reaching a technological culmination. So, to whom is this book directed? It will truly be of use to any of those described in the previous three categories. The curious person will find the material needed to advance toward the level of professional. This reader can use the book to obtain a deeper understanding of many topics. The professional, deeply involved with the overall subject matter of this book, may smugly grin with the self-satisfying attitude of, âI know all that!â This person, like myself, must recognize that there are many transformer topics. There is always room to learn. We believe that this book can also be a valuable resource to professionals. The expert may be so immersed in one or a few very narrow specialties within the field that he also may benefit greatly from the knowledge imparted in the peripheral specialties. The book is divided into three fundamental groupings: The first stand-alone chapter is devoted to Theory and Principles. The second chapter, Equipment Types, contains nine sections that individually treat major transformer types. The third chapter, which contains 14 sections, addresses Ancillary Topics associated with power transformers. Anyone with an interest in transformers will find a great deal of useful information.},

  Abstract                 = {The ThemeRiver visualization depicts thematic variations over time within a large collection of documents. The thematic changes are shown in the context of a time-line and corresponding external events. The focus on temporal thematic change within a context framework allows a user to discern patterns that suggest relationships or trends. For example, the sudden change of thematic strength following an external event may indicate a causal relationship. Such patterns are not readily accessible in other visualizations of the data. We use a river metaphor to convey several key notions. The document collection's time-line, selected thematic content and thematic strength are indicated by the river's directed flow, composition and changing width, respectively. The directed flow from left to right is interpreted as movement through time and the horizontal distance between two points on the river defines a time interval. At any point in time, the vertical distance, or width, of the river indicates the collective strength of the selected themes. Colored "currents" flowing within the river represent individual themes. A current's vertical width narrows or broadens to indicate decreases or increases in the strength of the individual theme},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial interpolation errors at 2816 grid points covering Canada are determined using 10- year averages of the solar irradiances for 130 stations unevenly distributed throughout the same area. Three specific interpolation schemes are evaluated (2 and 3 station inverse distance weighted interpolation and single station extrapolation) though the data set and algorithm (based on kriging) are sufficiently general that other strategies could also be evaluated. In southern Canada relative values of the extrapolation error for ten-year means are typically between 1 and 2% and decrease to less than 1% if values are interpolated using data from three stations. Errors are higher at coastal locations and in the Canadian Arctic due to generally greater interpolation distances and increased spatial variability. Lower actual irradiances also influences the relative errors. There is little advantage to including additional data from stations in adjacent areas of the U.S. since interpolation and extrapolation errors are generally already less than the errors associated with measurement and modelling procedures and with temporal sampling (i.e., the long-term representativeness of a 10-year mean).},

The absolute values of the systematic differences were of similar magnitude (2-2.5 per cent) at the two locations. Both the individual and systematic differences showed marked seasonal and interannual variability,w ith all relativee rrors being greatest in the winter months. However, at both locations the absolute values of these same statistics showed a strong dependence on the observed irradiance. The variability of these discrepancies illustrates the need to specify the basic time interval and irradiance when selecting or quoting a measurement error.},

This model will be useful in the study and design of the structure and building that will contain the telescope. This paper summarizes the results of our initial analysis of selected wind data obtained at the site with a sampling frequency of 40 Hz. For each data set we calculated the power spectral density. A power law / f^gamma for the high frequency part of the spectrum was fitted and the spectral index gamma was found to be in the range of 0.625 to 0.969, and to depend on the wind direction. The frequency for the maximum of the spectrum lies in the range of 0.008 to 0.017 Hz. These studies should be repeated once the building is installed at the site due to changes in the site topography},

The approach demonstrates that the relative power Output Variability for a fleet of identical PV systems (same size, orientation, and spacing) can be quantified by identifying the number of PV systems and their Dispersion Factor. The Dispersion Factor is a new variable that captures the relationship between PV Fleet configuration, Cloud Transit Speed, and the Time Interval over which variability is evaluated. Results indicate that Relative Output Variability: (1) equals the inverse of the square root of the number of systems for fully dispersed PV systems; and (2) could be further minimized for optimally-spaced PV systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Maximum power point trackers (MPPTs) play an important role in photovoltaic (PV) power systems because they maximize the power output from a PV system for a given set of conditions, and therefore maximize the array efficiency. Thus, an MPPT can minimize the overall system cost. MPPTs find and maintain operation at the maximum power point, using an MPPT algorithm. Many such algorithms have been proposed. However, one particular algorithm, the perturb-and-observe (P\&O) method, claimed by many in the literature to be inferior to others, continues to be by far the most widely used method in commercial PV MPPTs. Part of the reason for this is that the published comparisons between methods do not include an experimental comparison between multiple algorithms with all algorithms optimized and a standardized MPPT hardware. This paper provides such a comparison. MPPT algorithm performance is quantified through the MPPT efficiency. In this work, results are obtained for three optimized algorithms, using a microprocessor-controlled MPPT operating from a PV array and also a PV array simulator. It is found that the P\&O method, when properly optimized, can have MPPTefficiencies well in excess of 97%, and is highly competitive against other MPPT algorithms},

  Abstract                 = {An artificial neural network (ANN) is an information-processing system that has certain performance characteristics in common with biological neural networks. Artificial neural networks have been developed as generalisations of mathematical models, of human cognition or neural biology. During the last three decades, artificial neural networks have been extensively employed in numerous fields of science and technology. For instance they have been used in signal processing, medicine, pattern recognition, robotics, control, forecasting, speech production, speech recognition, business, manufacturing, power systems and also in the renewable energy and solar energy fields. As a computation and learning paradigm, they are proposed as an alternative approach for addressing complex problems. This chapter consists of two parts. In the first part a bibliographic review of how artificial neural networks have been used in the renewable energy field in general and more specifically in the solar energy field is presented. This review includes also applications of artificial neural networks in the photovoltaic (PV) and in the solar radiation fields. Following this review, the chapter is centred on the research results obtained by the authors on using artificial neural networks, and more particularly the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), in the solar radiation and in the photovoltaic fields. Among the many types of networks, supervised models have consolidated as the most robust and easy to employ when applicable. Usually, these models are implemented via feedforward architectures such as, the Multi-Layer Perceptron. The Multi-Layer Perceptron is the most widely used type of supervised neural network employed for approximation tasks. One of the most appealing properties of these neural network architectures is their potential use for function approximation, which is due to their universal approximation capabilities. The use of the MLP in the photovoltaic and solar radiation fields has been carried out by the authors and is giving very satisfactory results. The authors have used the MLP for generating the long-term solar radiation series needed in the design of photovoltaic systems. The MLP was also used as a very useful tool for generating Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) curves for stand-alone photovoltaic systems. Finally, the MLP was used to extrapolate V-I curves of PV modules recorded at non-Standard Test Conditions to Standard Test Conditions V-I curves. In all the above applications, the problems were solved satisfactorily with a very simple structure for the MLP.},

  Abstract                 = {Several methods for sizing stand alone photovoltaic (pv) systems has been developed. The more simplistic are called intuitive methods. They are a useful tool for a first approach in sizing stand alone photovoltaic systems. Nevertheless they are very inaccurate. Analytical methods use equations to describe the pv system size as a function of reliability. These ones are more accurate than the previous ones but they are also not accurate enough for sizing of high reliability. In a third group there are methods which use system simulations. These ones are called numerical methods. Many of the analytical methods employ the concept of reliability of the system or the complementary term: loss of load probability (LOLP). In this paper an improvement for obtaining LOLP curves based on the neural network called Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is presented. A unique MLP for many locations of Spain has been trained and after the training, the MLP is able to generate LOLP curves for any value and location.},

Macmillan Publishing Company; Hornik, K., Stinchcombe, M., White, H., 1989. Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators. Neural Networks, 2(5), 359â366]. To obtain a solar radiation map it is necessary to know the solar radiation of many points spread wide across the zone of the map where it is going to be drawn. For most of the locations all over the world the records of these data (solar radiation in whatever scale, daily or hourly values) are nonexistent. Only very few locations have the privilege of having good meteorological stations where records of solar radiation have being registered. But even in those locations with historical records of solar data, the quality of these solar series is not as good as it should be for most purposes. In addition, to draw solar radiation maps the number of points on the maps (real sites) that it is necessary to work with makes this problem difficult to solve. Nevertheless, with the application of the methodology proposed in this paper, this problem has been solved and solar radiation maps have been obtained for a small region of Spain: JaeÂ?n province, a southern province of Spain between parallels 38 250 N and 37 250 N, and meridians 4 100 W and 2 100 W, and for a larger region: Andaluc\iÂ?a, the most southern region of Spain situated between parallels 38 400 N and 36 000 N, and meridians 7 300 W and 1 400 W.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work, a methodology based on the neural network model called multilayer perceptron (MLP) to solve a typical problem in solar energy is presented. This methodology consists of the generation of synthetic series of hourly solar irradiation. The model presented is based on the capacity of the MLP for finding relations between variables for which interrelation is unknown explicitly. The information available can be included progressively at the series generator at different stages. A comparative study with other solar irradiation synthetic generation methods has been done in order to demonstrate the validity of the one proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a neural network method for generating solar radiation synthetic series is proposed and evaluated. In solar energy application fields such as photovoltaic systems and solar heating systems, the need of long sequences of solar irradiation data is fundamental. Nevertheless those series are not frequently available: in many locations the records are incomplete or difficult to manage, whereas in other places there are no records at all. Hence, many authors have proposed different methods to generate synthetic series of irradiation trying to preserve some statistical properties of the recorded ones. The neural procedure shown here represents a simple alternative way to address this problem. A comparative study of the neural-based synthetic series and series generated by other methods has been carried out with the objective of demonstrating the universality and generalisation capabilities of this new approach. The results show the good performance of this irradiation series generation method.},

Such load forecasting results not only cannot identify where the power load takes place but also is not helpful for power facilities construction location planning. On the other hand, the power industry has been moving toward a deregulated environment recently. The results of regional load prediction could be used by power retailers to find their potential business opportunities. For transmission and distribution operators, accurate regional load forecasting can help them in long term power system planning and construction. Thus, regional load forecasting is getting more and more important for electricity providers in a deregulated power market. In this paper, empirical data are collected to formulate an artificial neural network model to predict the regional peak load of Taiwan. Based on the forecast results, some suggestions for Taiwan power market providers are presented.},

It is found that the geographical variation in ambient temperature and yearly irradiation causes a decrease in overall yearly PV performance from 3 to 13% relative to the performance under Standard Test Conditions, with the highest decrease found in the Mediterranean region.

  Abstract                 = {We present a methodology for estimating the average profiles of daytime and daily ambient temperature from a spatially-continuous database for any location within Europe. The primary database with 1-km grid resolution was developed by interpolation of monthly averages of 7 daily values of temperature: minimum and maximum and 5 measurements at 3-h intervals from 6:00 to 18:00 hours Greenwich Mean Time. With a little over 800 meteorological stations available, we obtained a cross-validation root mean square error of 1.0-1.2 °C, while the interpolation error is lower, at 0.5-0.7 °C. A polynomial fit was applied to estimate the daytime temperature profile (assuming only time from sunrise to sunset) from the interpolated 3-h measurements for each month. The curve fit coefficients make it possible to calculate a number of derived data, such as average daytime temperature, maximum daytime temperature and time of its occurrence within the region. An example demonstrates the coupling of the simulated daytime temperature profile with a model for assessing the relative efficiency of electricity generation by crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules. As an alternative to the polynomial fitting, a double-cosine method was applied to enable calculation of daily (24-h) temperature profiles for each month using interpolated minimum and maximum temperatures. Compared to the polynomial curve-fitting, this method does not offer lower errors, but it provides data which are more suitable for estimation of solar thermal heating or calculation of degree days for building heating/cooling.},

The calculation is based on the Photovoltaic Geographic Information System (PVGIS), which integrates modelling tools with the pan-European solar radiation database. The results indicate that in the case of a PV system with two seasonal inclination angles, the maximum yearly gains, compared to the single fixed optimum angle, do not exceed 60â70 kWh per kWp in the Mediterranean region, while in the Baltic and North Sea regions this configuration gives less than 20 kWh extra. For the case of two-axis tracking, the relative energy gain compared to single fixed optimum angle is highest in the Northern latitudes but the absolute gain is much higher in the South. Typical yearly gains in Portugal and the Mediterranean region are in the range of 400â600 kWh per kWp. The smallest absolute increase is found in the Northwest and Central Europe including the British Isles, where it is lower than 250 kWh per kWp. For crystalline silicon we also investigate the effects of temperature and shallow-angle reflectivity on the comparison between fixed and tracking systems. While both effects reduce the overall energy output, the temperature degradation is stronger for tracking systems while the reflectivity reduces output more for fixed systems. The combined effect is almost equal for fixed and two-axis tracking systems.},

Their performance evaluated on very clear condition measurements are within 4% in term of standard deviation. The conclusions are that the accuracy of the input parameters such as the turbidity is crucial in the validity of the obtained radiation components, and that the choice of a specific model is secondary. The model selection criteria should be based upon either implementation simplicity, input parameter availability (Linke turbidity or aerosol optical depth) or the capacity of the model to produce spectral radiation.},

For Switzerland, BIPV and other types show high PR > 0.80, but average PR values lower than expected were obtained. For Japan, lessons learnt from the current monitoring programmes are used to improve PV system performance showing constant performance at high level. As an outcome of this work, reliable and worldwide monitoring performance data and results are available for future developments of financing schemes (e.g. feed-in-tariffs) in order to stimulate the PV market.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy is a vital input for social and economic development of any nation. With increasing agricultural and industrial activities in the country, the demand for energy is also increasing. Formulation of an energy model will help in the proper allocation of widely available renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, bioenergy and small hydropower in meeting the future energy demand in India. During the last decade several new concepts of energy planning and management such as decentralized planning, energy conservation through improved technologies, waste recycling, integrated energy planning, introduction of renewable energy sources and energy forecasting have emerged. In this paper an attempt has been made to understand and review the various emerging issues related to the energy modeling. The different types of models such as energy planning models, energy supplyâdemand models, forecasting models, renewable energy models, emission reduction models, optimization models have been reviewed and presented. Also, models based on neural network and fuzzy theory have been reviewed and discussed. The review paper on energy modeling will help the energy planners, researchers and policy makers widely.},

The operating temperature was used as an indicator of the stress on the transformer.

  Abstract                 = {The increasing complexity of coupled hydrodynamic-ecosystem models may require skill assessment methods that both quantify various aspects of model performance and visually summarize these aspects within compact diagrams. Hence summary diagrams, such as the Taylor diagram [Taylor, 2001, Journal of Geophysical Research, 106, D7, 7183â7192], may meet this requirement by exploiting mathematical relationships between widely known statistical quantities in order to succinctly display a suite of model skill metrics in a single plot. In this paper, sensitivity results from a coupled model are compared with Sea-viewing Wide Field-ofviewSensor (SeaWiFS) satellite ocean color data in order to assess the utility of the Taylor diagram and to develop a set of alternatives. Summary diagrams are only effective as skill assessment tools insofar as the statistical quantities they communicate adequately capture differentiable aspects of model performance. Here we demonstrate how the linear correlation coefficients and variance comparisons (pattern statistics) that constitute a Taylor diagram may fail to identify other potentially important aspects of coupledmodel performance, even if these quantities appear close to their ideal values. An additional skill assessment tool, the target diagram, is developed in order to provide summary information about howthe pattern statistics and the bias (difference of mean values) each contribute to the magnitude of the total Root-Mean-Square Difference (RMSD). In addition, a potential inconsistency in the use of RMSD statistics as skill metrics for overall model and observation agreement is identified: underestimates of the observed field?s variance are rewardedwhen the linear correlation scores are less than unity. An alternative skill score and skill score-based summary diagram is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Radio frequency (RF) detection of partial discharges (PD) is a long-istablished principle, being described in the international standard for partial discharge measurement. The growing market for mobile communication devices in recent years has led to big reductions in the cost of electronic hardware operating in the VHF and UHF bands, making advanced measurements of PD in these bands increasingly affordable. Some 20 years ago, ultra-high frequency methods for PD detection were pioneered in gas-insulated substations (GIS) and have since become widely accepted. Locating PD in GIS is essentially a one-dimensional problem. More recent research into PD location in power transformers, also using the UHF method, has had to address the more challenging problem of PD location in three-dimensions. Both the GIS and transformer applications monitor enclosed volumes, where the PD is within a metalclad system that traps the signal and provides good screening of external RF interference. At the same time, other researchers have developed RF detection and location systems for open environments, such as complete air-insulated substations. When deployed in a fixed installation or a surveying vehicle equipped with GPS, this system is capable of monitoring insulation defects as they develop, and provides a location capability using sophisticated signal processing. This paper begins with an overview of some aspects of radiometric monitoring techniques and goes on to outline some research challenges which it is hoped will attract the attention of the many researchers who are continuing to advance the areas of radiometric PD detection, measurement and location technology. },

The effects of position, size, current amplitude and pulse shape of the PD source on the UHF signal tan be predicted using this theory. Excitation of propagating electromagnetic waves by a PD current pulse within the coaxial waveguides formed by GIS components is explained by making use of dyadic Green's functions for the electric fields of propagating modes. Experiments with a coaxial test chamber are used to verify the theoretical predictions, and comparisons are made between measured and simulated UHF signals. Some implications for the UHF measurement of PD are discussed, together with positioning and sensitivity requirements for UHF couplers. A scheme is proposed for standardizing PD measurements made using the UHF technique. },

This model relates to UHF signals used for the detection of partial discharge (PD) caused by defects in gas-insulated substations (GIS). Application of the theory is demonstrated by comparison with experimental results for a cavity excited by a PD source. A technique for the injection of calibrated current pulses for PD simulation is also presented. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the life cycle assessment (LCA) for photovoltaic (PV) power plants in the new ecoinvent database. Twelve different, grid-connected photovoltaic systems were studied for the situation in Switzerland in the year 2000. They are manufactured as panels or laminates, from monocrystalline or polycrystalline silicon, installed on facades, slanted or flat roofs, and have 3 kWp capacity. The process data include quartz reduction, silicon purification, wafer, panel and laminate production, mounting structure, 30 years operation and dismantling. In contrast to existing LCA studies, country-specific electricity mixes have been considered in the life cycle inventory (LCI) in order to reflect the present market situation. The new approach for the allocation procedure in the inventory of silicon purification, as a critical issue of former studies, is discussed in detail. The LCI for photovoltaic electricity shows that each production stage is important for certain elementary flows. A life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) shows that there are important environmental impacts not directly related to the energy use (e.g., process emissions of NOx from wafer etching). The assumption for the used supply energy mixes is important for the overall LCIA results of different production stages. The presented life cycle inventories for photovoltaic power plants are representative for newly constructed plants and for the average photovoltaic mix in Switzerland in the year 2000. A scenario for a future technology (until 2010) helps to assess the relative influence of technology improvements for some processes. The very detailed ecoinvent database forms a good basis for similar studies in other European countries or for other types of solar cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Artificial neural networks offer an alternative way to tackle complex and ill-defined problems. They can learn from examples, are fault tolerant in the sense that they are able to handle noisy and incomplete data, are able to deal with non-linear problems, and once trained can perform predictions and generalisations at high speed. They have been used in diverse applications in control, robotics, pattern recognition, forecasting, medicine, power systems, manufacturing, optimisation, signal processing, and social/psychological sciences. They are particularly useful in system modelling, such as in implementing complex mapping and system identification. This paper presents various applications of neural networks in energy problems in a thematic rather than a chronological or any other way. Artificial neural networks have been used by the author in the field of solar energy; for modelling and design of a solar steam generating plant, for the estimation of a parabolic-trough collector?s intercept factor and local concentration ratio and for the modelling and performance prediction of solar water-heating systems. They have also been used for the estimation of heating-loads of buildings, for the prediction of air Â¯ows in a naturally ventilated test room and for the prediction of the energy consumption of a passive solar building. In all such models, a multiple hidden-layer architecture has been used. Errors reported when using these models are well within acceptable limits, which clearly suggests that artiÂ®cial neural-networks can be used for modelling in other fields of energy production and use. The work of other researchers in the Â®eld of energy is also reported. This includes the use of artificial neural-networks in heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems, solar radiation, modelling and control of power-generation systems, load-forecasting and refrigeration.},

Diurnal variations have been taken into account to observe forecasts and its dependence on lead times. We find the ARMA (p,q) model suitable for prediction intervals and probability forecasts.},

During long-term exposure of photovoltaic modules to environmental stress, the ingress of water into the module is correlated with decreased performance. By using diffusivity measurements for water through ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), we have modeled moisture ingress using finite-element analysis with atmospheric data from various locations such as Miami, Florida. This analysis shows that because of the high diffusivity of EVA, even an impermeable glass back-sheet is incapable of preventing significant moisture ingress from the edges for a 20â30-year lifetime. Once moisture penetrates a module, it can condense and increase corrosion rates. Significantly reducing moisture ingress requires a true hermetic seal, the use of an encapsulant loaded with a desiccant, or the use of an encapsulant with a very low diffusivity. r 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Crystalline silicon modules achieve an energy break-even in 3 to 4 years. At the current R\&D pilot production rate (8% of capacity) the energy payback time for thin film copper indium diselenide modules is between 9 and 12 years, and in full production is | 2 years. Over their lifetime, these solar panels generate 7 to 14 times the energy required to produce them.

  Abstract                 = {This paper compares single-phase and three-phase inverters for grid-connected photovoltaic systems. It considers some of the fundamental performance characteristics, and compares the ratings, size, quantities, and the relative cost of the major components, as well as some grid-connection requirements. In terms of power semiconductor ratings, there is an increased power throughput in a three-phase inverter. Also, magnetic components like filter inductors and line-frequency transformers require less material and therefore they can be smaller, lighter, and cheaper. The DC link capacitor of a three-phase inverter has significantly less ripple current and can be substantially smaller without compromising lifetime and reliability. However, the control requirements and the quantity of auxiliary electronics are generally greater for a three-phase inverter. The three-phase grid connection is not always a serious impediment, and the potential to utilise components commonly found in small three-phase motor drive products could be a major cost benefit. The advantages of three-phase inverters described in this paper provide a designer with a number of degrees of freedom in which they can trade off performance and cost, and it should be possible to achieve an improvement over single-phase inverters at lower power levels than have previously been considered practical},

In this note we extend these techniques to estimate the parameters of exponentially damped sinusoidal signals in noise. The estimation procedure presented here makes use of "backward prediction" in addition to SVD. First, the method is applied to data consisting of one and two exponentially damped sinusoids. The choice of one and two signal components facilitates the comparison of estimation error in pole damping factors and pole frequencies to the appropriate Cramer-Rao (CR) bounds and to traditional methods of linear prediction. Second, our method is applied to an example due to Steiglitz [8] in which the data consists of noisy values of the impulse response samples (composed of many exponentially damped sinusoids) of a linear system having both poles and zeros. The poles of the system are accurately determined by our method and the zeros are obtained subsequently, using Shanks' method.},

  Abstract                 = {This contribution provides a review of the most recent wavelet applications in the field of earth sciences and is devoted to introducing and illustrating new wavelet analysis methods in the field of hydrology. Wavelet analysis remains unknown in the field of hydrology even though it clearly overcomes the well-known limits of the classical Fourier analysis. New wavelet-based tools are proposed to hydrologists in order to make wavelet analysis more attractive. First, a multiresolution continuous wavelet analysis method is shown to significantly improve the determination of the temporal-scale structure of a given signal. Second, the concept of wavelet entropy in both continuous and multiresolution frameworks is introduced allowing for an estimation of the temporal evolution of a given hydrological or climatologic signal's complexity. New insights in the scale-dependence of the relationship are exposed by introducing wavelet cross-correlation and wavelet coherence. Continuous wavelet cross-correlation provides a time-scale distribution of the correlation between two signals, whereas continuous wavelet coherence provides a qualitative estimator of the temporal evolution of the degree of linearity of the relationship between two signals on a given scale. These methods are applied to four large river runoffs and two global climatic indexes in a companion paper.},

  Abstract                 = {In the frame of IEA PVPS Task 7 Â»PV in the Built EnvironmentÂ« a survey was conducted to collect information on faults, failures and poor performance from PV plants. Data were collected from Australian, Austrian, British, Canadian, Dutch, German, Japanese, Spanish, Swedish, Swiss and US systems. The focus lies on residential systems with a nominal power of 1 â 5 kWp, but large systems up to the 3.3 MWp âSerreâ plant were included as well. Looking at failures statistics over time from residential PV programs shows the typical âlearning curveâ of decreasing failure rates. The inverter still proves to be the weakest component. Standard PV modules have reached a high quality standard today. They have matured over the last 20 years and show failure rates down to 0.01 % per year. However, there are some brands which exhibit less STC power than stated by the manufacturer. Inverters too, have matured remarkably. Experience from most recent projects shows troublefree operation for 10 years. Nevertheless, when a high buy-back rate has been contracted, then care should be given for a good service of the inverter manufacturer, for example a 24 h replacement warranty. Critical are novel electronic components, e.g. inverters, special grid interfaces or ac/dc RCDs. These need some field experience before they work reliably. Main reasons for low yield of some systems within the German Â»1000-Roofs- ProgrammeÂ« systems were inverter failures, over-rated power of modules, partial shading of the array, soiling, and faulty connections on the dc side. Failure analysis leads to recommendations for good design and installation practice and improved junction boxes. Modern Class II components offer the system designer the liberty to dismiss string diodes and string fuses. This results in simpler and more reliable systems. As a minimum level of maintenance it is recommended: â¢ To inspect arrays once per year â¢ To clean arrays regularly, if soiling is noticed. â¢ perform a monthly check of electrical production},

In sectors such as residential and the commercial sector the major part of the energy consumption takes place buildings. This includes energy used for controlling the climate in buildings and for the buildings themselves, but also energy used for appliances, lighting and other installed equipment. In other sectors a small part of the energy consumption is similar used for similar purposes in relation to the buildings. This is for instance the case for some buildings in the industry used for administration or some buildings agriculture or forestry. The energy efficiency of new buildings determines the building sectorâs energy consumption for far longer than other end-use sectors components determine their sectorâs efficiency. Buildings will typically be constructed to be used for many decades and, in some cases, for more than a hundred years. In other energy end uses, the capital lifetime for efficiency improvement will be, at most, a few decades.},

  Abstract                 = {This work explores the possibility of integrating the geographical elements such as orography and presence of water bodies as well as the latitudinal effects into an effective distance when interpolating meteorological fields. This effective distance may then be used in any interpolation methods instead of the standard geodetic distance. Several hundreds of sites are used in Europe to assess the benefits of several effective distances. The meteorological parameters under concern are ten-years averages of monthly means of daily sum of horizontal global irradiation, daily sum of sunshine duration, daily extremes of air temperature, atmospheric pressure and water vapor pressure, and of monthly sums of precipitation. This work demonstrates that taking into account the latitudinal effects in the distance increases the accuracy in interpolation. Such effects have been seldom mentioned in previous publications. The orographic effects may be partly corrected by adding the weighted difference in elevation to the geodetic distance. The following effective distance between the point P and each of the measuring sites Xi for all parameters, is found to give better results than the others: deff 2 = fNS 2 (dgeo 2 + foro 2 dh2) with fNS = 1 + 0.3 Â?FP -FXÂ? [1+ (sinFP + sinFX) / 2], where dgeo is the geodetic distance in km, latitudes FP and FX are expressed in degrees, dh is the difference in elevation between P and Xi (expressed in km) and foro is set to 500.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper explores energy and physical resource limitations to transitioning from fossil fuels to the large-scale generation of electricity with photovoltaic arrays. The model finds that business as usual models, which involve growth rates in world electricity demand of between 2% and 3.2% p.a., exhibit severe material difficulties before the end of this century. If the growth rate is lowered to 1% p.a., then it may be possible to reach the year 2100 before such difficulties, but it is likely that material constraints will occur early the next century. Steady state scenarios show that silicon based photovoltaic panels could, however, displace fossil fuels before the middle of the century, providing around the same order of magnitude as present (2010) world electricity demand. Scenarios also show that outcomes will be highly dependent upon the rate of improvement of photovoltaic technologies. The analysis does not contend that silicon PV technology is the only technology that will or can be adopted, but as the embodied energy content per kWh generated of this technology is similar to other renewable technologies, such as other solar technologies and wind, it can provide a baseline for examining a transition to a mixture of renewable energy sources.},

  Abstract                 = {The contribution of power production by photovoltaic (PV) systems to the electricity supply is constantly increasing. An efficient use of the fluctuating solar power production will highly benefit from forecast information on the expected power production. This forecast information is necessary for the management of the electricity grids and for solar energy trading. This paper presents an approach to predict regional PV power output based on forecasts up to three days ahead provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Focus of the paper is the description and evaluation of the approach of irradiance forecasting, which is the basis for PV power prediction. One day-ahead irradiance forecasts for single stations in Germany show a rRMSE of 36%. For regional forecasts, forecast accuracy is increasing in dependency on the size of the region. For the complete area of Germany, the rRMSE amounts to 13%. Besides the forecast accuracy, also the specification of the forecast uncertainty is an important issue for an effective application. We present and evaluate an approach to derive weather specific prediction intervals for irradiance forecasts. The accuracy of PV power prediction is investigated in a case study.},

In particular, single vertical axis tracking, also called azimuth tracking, allows for energy gains up to 40%, compared with optimally tilted fully static arrays. This paper examines the theoretical aspects associated with the design of azimuth tracking, taking into account shadowing between different trackers and back-tracking features. Then, the practical design of the trackers installed at the 1 4MW Tudela PV plant is presented and discussed. Finally, this tracking alternative is compared with the more conventional fully stationary approach.},

  Abstract                 = { This paper presents coherent representations of electric power systems signals. These representations are obtained by employing adaptive signal decompositions. They provide a tool to identify structures composing a signal and constitute an approach to represent a signal from its identified components. We use the matching pursuits algorithm, which is a greedy adaptive decomposition, that has the potential of decomposing a signal into coherent components. The dictionary employed is composed of damped sinusoids in order to obtain signal components closely related to power systems phenomena. In addition, we present an effective method to suppress the pre-echo and post-echo artifacts that often appear when using the matching pursuits. However, the use of a dictionary of damped sinusoids alone does not ensure that the decomposition will be meaningful in physical terms. To overcome this constraint, we develop a technique leading to efficient coherent damped-sinusoidal decompositions that are closely related to the physical phenomena being observed. The effectiveness of the proposed method for compression of synthetic and natural signals is tested, obtaining high compression ratios along with high signal-to-noise ratio.},

Results show that they all produce large errors at steep slopes. The errors are minimum during the summer months. The isotropic model under-estimated consistently throughout the year resulting in the worst performance. Hay?s model also under-estimated constantly but by a smaller amount. Klucher?s model overestimated in the summer and under-estimated in the winter, but can be considered just as general and accurate as Hay?s model for estimating insolation on inclined surfaces.},

  Abstract                 = {Second generation prototype photovoltaic facades of reduced costs incorporating devices with optically concentrating elements (PRIDE) incorporate 6 mm wide lsquoSaturnrsquo solar cells at the absorber of the dielectric concentrator. The concentrators were made using injection moulding technique with potential to manufacture in large-scale applications. Four different concentrator panels have been experimentally verified at outdoors to identify the non-identical current-voltage (I-V) curves. The I-V curve, fill factor and solar to electrical conversion efficiency of four PRIDE concentrator modules have been evaluated from the 24 manufactured in the lsquoIDEOCONTErsquo project. The maximum solar to electrical conversion efficiency and the fill factor of the PRIDE concentrator were 9â¢1 and 70%, respectively. The mismatch loss of the lsquounit concentratorsrsquo has been identified that occurred due to the lack of bonding between the concentrator unit and the solar cell and the rear glass. The average power concentration ratio of PRIDE concentrators manufactured by the improved method was 2â¢10 compared to a similar non-concentrating panel and the optical efficiency of the PRIDE system was 83%.

  Abstract                 = {The measurement of partial discharges (PD) is a non-destructive and sensitive diagnostic tool for the condition assessment of insulating systems. Two major tasks of PD measurements may be distinguished, (i) PD detection, hence providing evidence and the type of the PD and (ii) the location of the PD. The question "Where is the PD source?" is amongst others tremendously important for scheduling and starting maintenance/repair actions cost and time efficiently or to perform a risk analysis. Here the possibility to geometrically localize the flaw, by means of arrival times of acoustic PD signals, gets an extremely interesting option. Precise acoustic arrival times are consequently essential to accurately locate PD in a power transformer. The averaging of acoustic PD signals helps to enhance the acoustic sensitivity. The acoustic detection limit is lowered significantly and the determination of the arrival times is made possible for weaker PD. Supplementary steps, like automatic objective arrival time determination or additional wavelet-based de-noising further improve the overall location accuracy. A new location approach works with pseudo-times and allows for the use of robust direct solvers instead of the previously used iterative algorithms. },

An important component of our study is the development of a set of criteria for selecting relevant inputs. The input variables are selected using a version of the Gamma test combined with a genetic algorithm. The solar geotemporal variables are found to be critically important, while the most relevant meteorological variables include sky cover, probability of precipitation, and maximum and minimum temperatures. Using the relevant input sets identified by the Gamma test, the developed forecasting models improve RMSEs for GHI by 10–15% over the reference model. Prediction intervals based on regression of the squared residuals on the input variables are also derived.},

  Abstract                 = {Photovoltaic (PV) modules in real operation present angular losses in reference to their behaviour in standard test conditions, due to the angle of incidence of the incident radiation and the surface soil. Although these losses are not always negligible, they are commonly not taken into account when correcting the electrical characteristics of the PV module or estimating the energy production of PV systems. The main reason of this approximation is the lack of easy-to-use mathematical expressions for the angular losses calculation. This paper analyses these losses on PV modules and presents an analytical model based on theoretical and experimental results. The proposed model "ts monocrystalline as well as polycrystalline and amorphous silicon PV modules, and contemplates the existence of super"cial dust. With it angular losses integrated over time periods of interest can be easily calculated. Monthly and annual losses have been calculated for 10 di!erent European sites, having diverse climates and latitudes (ranging from32 3 to 523), and considering di!erent module tilt angles.},

The model is applied directly to power calculations, without the need to consider the whole current-voltage curve. This allows the model to be used with common yield estimation software. The model takes into account both the shaded fraction of the array area and the number of blocks (a group of solar cells protected by a bypass diode) affected by shade. The results of an experimental testing campaign on several shaded PV arrays to check the validity of model are also reported.},

The most important parameters to be taken into consideration in wind modelling are: the frequency spectrum model, gust occurrence probability, operation under wakes and the coherence inside the wind farm. From a single turbine operation to a large wind farm different models are analyzed and their validity is discussed.},

Through this system the energy is converted, adapted and injected into the electric utility grid. In this way an amount of electrical energy consumed by one given customer is produced, having the advantage that it can be installed easily in the proper place of consumption, dispensing the use of a transmission system. The current has sinusoidal shape in the system output, taking as reference the electric grid, obtaining low total harmonic distortion, thus the quality of the electric energy is preserved. Moreover, other requirements are achieved, as the galvanic isolation between the panels and the utility grid, and the protection against energy failure. The power stages, the control strategy, the systemâs operation principle, the simulation and experimental results acquired with the prototype constructed in laboratory are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The Linke turbidity coefficient has been measured for the first time in the island of Crete, in the Mediterranean sea. Short time series data were used to calculate the beam irradiance through the global and diffuse irradiance on a horizontal plane. Strong seasonal effects on the monthly averaged TL values are not observed, while their profile displays a smooth transition from lower to higher values. Examination of the daily averages reveals TL values as low as 2.0 and as high as 4.0. The most frequent values of the turbidity are found in the range of 2.3â3.5. Archival global irradiance data from the same site are also used to estimate the turbidity with the aid of a robust estimator and two simple, analytical models. The usefulness of this approach is validated with data from a number of networks registering the solar radiation. The proposed method allows to estimate the turbidity with an rms error of 0.3, using only, good quality, global irradiance data. Large amounts of data can easily be processed with the proposed method.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this work is to develop a hybrid model which will be used to predict the daily global solar radiation data by combining between an artificial neural network (ANN) and a library of Markov transition matrices (MTM) approach. Developed model can generate a sequence of global solar radiation data using a minimum of input data (latitude, longitude and altitude), especially in isolated sites. A data base of daily global solar radiation data has been collected from 60 meteorological stations in Algeria during 1991â2000. Also a typical meteorological year (TMY) has been built from this database. Firstly, a neural network block has been trained based on 60 known monthly solar radiation data from the TMY. In this way, the network was trained to accept and even handle a number of unusual cases. The neural network can generate the monthly solar radiation data. Secondly, these data have been divided by corresponding extraterrestrial value in order to obtain the monthly clearness index values. Based on these monthly clearness indexes and using a library of MTM block we can generate the sequences of daily clearness indexes. Known data were subsequently used to investigate the accuracy of the prediction. Furthermore, the unknown validation data set produced very accurate prediction; with an RMSE error not exceeding 8% between the measured and predicted data. A correlation coefficient ranging from 90% and 92% have been obtained; also this model has been compared to the traditional models AR, ARMA, Markov chain, MTM and measured data. Results obtained indicate that the proposed model can successfully be used for the estimation of the daily solar radiation data for any locations in Algeria by using as input the altitude, the longitude, and the latitude. Also, the model can be generalized for any location in the world. An application of sizing PV systems in isolated sites has been applied in order to confirm the validity of this model.},

  Abstract                 = {The combination of wavelet theory and neural networks has lead to the development of wavelet networks. Wavelet-networks are feed-forward networks using wavelets as activation functions. Wavelet-networks have been used successfully in various engineering applications such as classification, identification and control problems. In this paper, the use of adaptive wavelet-network architecture in finding a suitable forecasting model for predicting the daily total solar-radiation is investigated. Total solar-radiation is considered as the most important parameter in the performance prediction of renewable energy systems, particularly in sizing photovoltaic (PV) power systems. For this purpose, daily total solar-radiation data have been recorded during the period extending from 1981 to 2001, by a meteorological station in Algeria. The wavelet-network model has been trained by using either the 19 years of data or one year of the data. In both cases the total solar radiation data corresponding to year 2001 was used for testing the model. The network was trained to accept and handle a number of unusual cases. Results indicate that the model predicts daily total solar-radiation values with a good accuracy of approximately 97% and the mean absolute percentage error is not more than 6%. In addition, the performance of the model was compared with different neural network structures and classical models. Training algorithms for wavelet-networks require smaller numbers of iterations when compared with other neural networks. The model can be used to fill missing data in weather databases. Additionally, the proposed model can be generalized and used in different locations and for other weather data, such as sunshine duration and ambient temperature. Finally, an application using the model for sizing a PV-power system is presented in order to confirm the validity of this model.},

  Abstract                 = {Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming useful as alternate approaches to conventional techniques or as components of integrated systems. They have been used to solve complicated practical problems in various areas and are becoming more and more popular nowadays. AItechniques have the following features: can learn from examples; are fault tolerant in the sense that they are able to handle noisy and incomplete data; are able to deal with non-linear problems; and once trained can perform prediction and generalization at high speed. AI-based systems are being developed and deployed worldwide in a myriad of applications, mainly because of their symbolic reasoning, flexibility and explanation capabilities. AI have been used and applied in different sectors, such as engineering, economics, medicine, military, marine, etc. They have also been applied for modeling, identification, optimization, prediction, forecasting, and control of complex systems. The main objective of this paper is to present an overview of the AI-techniques for sizing photovoltaic (PV) systems: stand-alone PVs, grid-connected PV systems, PV-wind hybrid systems, etc. Published literature presented in this paper show the potential of AI as a design tool for the optimal sizing of PV systems. Additionally, the advantage of using an AI-based sizing of PV systems is that it provides good optimization, especially in isolated areas, where the weather data are not always available.},

It uses the same approach as an earlier paper by Walraven, but has a more simplified form. This subject of the calculation of the solar position is revisited because of the somewhat confusing sequence of notes and letters that followed Walraven's publication in this journal and because of a report challenging the accuracy claimed by him. The Almanac approximation is compared to exact values and to some commonly used approximations. An appendix contains an annotated subroutine in FORTRAN, which should be easily converted to other programming languages.},

Hourly recorded data of air temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity for two stations, Valladolid and Madrid (Spain) were selected to develop the method and a TRY was obtained. Monthly average solar radiation values were calculated taking into account the temperature and solar radiation correlations. Four different methodologies were used to evaluate hourly global solar radiation from hourly weather data of temperature and, as a consequence, four different TRYs with common data sets of temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity were generated for Valladolid and Madrid (Spain) stations. In order to evaluate the four different methodologies, TRYs data were compared with long-term measured data series using statistical estimators such as average, standard deviation, root mean square error (rmse) and mean bias error (mbe). Festa and Ratto and the TAG model, from Aguiar and Collares-Pereira, respectively, turned out to be the best methods for generating hourly solar irradiation data. The best performance was shown by the TRY0 year which was based on the solar radiation models mentioned above. The results show that the best reference year for each site varies with the season and the characteristics of the station.},

In this short period, the number of radiometric stations in the region increased from 30 to 75. A simple reliability index was defined to characterize the ability of a given station to supply quality data during the study period. Most of the data fulfilled the control procedures; moreover, some data could be recalculated from daily and 10-min records. However, data from certain stations were removed. Then, the stability of the solar radiation was assessed through statistical analyses. Monthly global radiation followed normal distributions in 35 out of 36months, December 2007 being the only exception. Irradiation was more stable in summer and winter months than in spring and autumn. Records from certain stations showed a high correlation. Solar radiation from two station networks taken from the dataset was interpolated in order to exemplify the improvement obtained from using a higher quality dataset when mapping this variable. The obtained database can be used in further research.},

The autocorrelation coefficients are computed and the correlogram is found compatible with the real diurnal variation of mean wind speed. The stochastic time series analysis is found to be suitable for the description of autoregressive model that involves a time lag of one month for the mean monthly prediction and one day for the mean daily wind speed prediction. The results on a testing data indicate that the neural network approach outperforms the AR model as indicated by the prediction graph and by the root mean square errors.},

These individuals play a significant role in designing and developing new products and manufacturing systems and processes, and they also improve existing systems.

Although many of the methods we present are fundamental to statistical analysis in other disciplines, such as business and management, the life sciences, and the social sciences, we have elected to focus on an engineering-oriented audience. We believe that this approach will best serve students in engineering and the chemical/physical sciences and will allow them to concentrate on the many applications of statistics in these disciplines. We have worked hard to ensure that our examples and exercises are engineering- and science-based, and in almost all cases we have used examples of real dataâeither taken from a published source or based on our consulting experiences. We believe that engineers in all disciplines should take at least one course in statistics. Unfortunately, because of other requirements, most engineers will only take one statistics course. This book can be used for a single course, although we have provided enough material for two courses in the hope that more students will see the important applications of statistics in their everyday work and elect a second course. We believe that this book will also serve as a useful reference.},

The only input parameter which is required is the monthly mean value of daily global irradiation, which is available for most locations. The procedure to obtain new series is based on the use of a multiplicative autoregressive moving-average statistical model for time series with regular and seasonal components. The multiplicative nature of this models enables us to capture the two types of relationships observed in recorded hourly series of global irradiation: on the one hand, the relationship between the value at one hour and the value at the previous hour; and on the other hand, the relationship between the value at one hour in one day and the value at the same hour in the previous day. In this paper the main drawback which arises when using these models to generate new series is solved: namely, the need for available recorded series in order to obtain the three parameters contained in the statistical ARMA model which is proposed (autoregressive coefficient, moving-average coefficient and variance of the error term). Specifically, expressions which enable estimatation of these parameters using only monthly mean values of daily global irradiation are proposed in this paper.},

As monthly hourly exposure series of global radiation are not stationary, they are modified in order to remove the observed trends. A multiplicative autoregressive moving average model with regular and seasonal components was used. It is statistically accepted that this is the true model which generates most of the analyzed sequences. However, the underlying parameters of the model vary from one location to another and from one month to another.

The computed mean turbulence parameters are shown to be influenced by both topography and wake effects. Power spectra are derived and compared with the von Karman formulation during free stream and wake conditions and the corresponding turbulence length scales are determined. The analysis reveals that the von Karman spectrum is suitable for the structure of the turbulence measured at some locations in free stream conditions. However, intense topography effects like flow separation and wake effects are not adequately modelled by this formulation. The turbulent length scales exhibit a considerable variation with direction. During wake conditions and at around 1.8D separation distance, length scales are higher compared to those of free stream, whereas at separation distances greater than 6.7D topography effects have a stronger influence on the spectra and the length scale values than the wake effects.},

HELIOSAT-3 will supply high-quality solar radiation data gained from the exploitation of existing Earth observation technologies and will take advantage of the enhanced capabilities of the new Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites. The expected quality represents a substantial improvement with respect to the available methods and will better match the needs of companies and other customers of the resulting products. These goals will be achieved by an improvement of the current semi-empirical Heliosat calculation schemes (see section 2) as well as by the development and establishment of a new type of calculation scheme. This new type will be based on radiative transfer models (RTM) using the information of atmospheric parameters retrieved from the MSG satellite (clouds, ozone, water vapor) and the GOME/ATSR-2 satellites (aerosols). Within this paper, the new type of the solar irradiance calculation scheme, including the functional treatment of the diurnal variation of the solar irradiance, is described.},

  Abstract                 = {All solar energy applications require readily available, site-oriented and long-term solar radiation data. A typical database comprises of global, direct and diffuse solar irradiance, duration of sunshine and complementary data like cloud cover, atmospheric turbidity, humidity, temperature, etc. However, most of these stations do not provide complete if any information on solar data, chiefly due to the capital and maintenance costs that measuring instruments incur. For instance, global radiation is the most frequently measured parameter, its two components, i.e. diffuse and direct irradiance are often not measured. Improvements have been made to the meteorological radiation model MRM which, had been developed by Muneer et al. as a simple broadband irradiance estimation model based on synoptic information, by incorporating the sunshine information in the modelâs regressions. The result of the improvement of the model is a considerable reduction in biases and scatter in the comparison between estimated and measured data. The improved meteorological radiation model, IMRM is more accurate, by up to 70% in some cases, than its predecessor in estimating, global and diffuse horizontal irradiance. When sunshine, atmospheric pressure and temperature are not measured by a nearby station, yet cloud information is recorded, radiation estimation models based on cloud cover, CRM, can be used. Three CRMs have been compared to newly proposed models. It was found that models with locally fitted coefficients gave a more accurate estimation of the solar radiation than CRMs with generalized coefficients. The newly proposed model performed better that the older generation models. The third section of the article deals with estimation of diffuse radiation and possible improvements in its modeling. In this section, apart from clearness index (kt), influence of the synoptic parameters of sunshine fraction (SF), cloud cover (CC) and air mass (m) on diffuse fraction of global radiation (k) is studied both qualitatively and quantitatively. It is found that, SF shows a strong bearing on the kâkt relationship followed by CC and then m. As a next step, a series of models are developed for k as a polynomial function of kt, SF, CC and m. After an extensive evaluation procedure, a regression model is selected such that the diffuse radiation can be estimated with reasonable accuracy without making the model overtly complex. It was found that among all the models, the composite model involving all parameters provides the most accurate estimation of diffuse radiation. The site-specific models are further investigated for any appreciable correlations between different locations and their possible attributions. It was also found that a single model could more than adequately estimate the diffuse radiation for the locations within a given region. Three optimum models are also recommended for each region, in view of the fact that information on all parameters is not necessarily available for all sites. This study reveals a significant improvement from the conventional kâkt regression models to the presently proposed models, therefore, leading to more accurate estimation of diffuse radiation by approximately 50%.},

Several broadband solar radiation model approaches, including some developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, for estimating direct beam, total hemispherical and diffuse sky radiation are briefly reviewed. The latter include the Bird clear sky model for global, direct beam, and diffuse terrestrial solar radiation; the Direct Insolation Simulation Code (DISC) for estimating direct beam radiation from global measurements; and the METSTAT (Meteorological and Statistical) and Climatological Solar Radiation (CSR) models that estimate solar radiation from meteorological data.

  Abstract                 = {Energy yield and occupation of land are two parameters that must be optimized when designing a large PV plant. This paper presents the results of simulating the energy yield of flat panels for some locations and different tracking strategies as a function of the ground cover ratio. Some interesting results for design purposes, such as the optimal solar trackers depending on the land availability or the energy gains of every tracking strategy, are shown. For example, the energy gains associated to one northâsouth axis tracking, referenced to static surfaces, ranges from 18 to 25%, and from 37 to 45% for the two-axes tracker for reasonable ground cover ratios. To achieve these results, a simulation tool with appropriate models to calculate the energy yield for different solar trackers has been developed},

  Abstract                 = {With the advent of the , procedures to test the compliance of SHS fluorescent lamps with the standard have been developed. Definition of the laboratory testing procedures is a necessary step in any lamp quality assurance procedure. Particular attention has been paid to test simplicity and to affordability, in order to facilitate local application of the testing procedures, for example by the organisations which carry out electrification programmes. The set of test procedures has been applied to a representative collection of 42 lamps from many different countries, directly acquired in the current photovoltaic rural electrification market. Tests apply to: lamp resistance under normal operating conditions; lamp reliability under extreme conditions; under abnormal conditions; and lamp luminosity. Results are discussed and some recommendations for updating the relevant standard are given. The selected technical standard, together with the proposed testing procedures, form the basis of a complete quality assurance tool that can be applied locally in normal electrical laboratories. Full testing of a lamp requires less than one month, which is very reasonable on the context of quality assurance programmes. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We survey work that emphasizes scale, such as estimation of variance, and the scale exponent of processes with a specific scale behaviour, such as 1/f processes. We present some of our own work on locally stationary wavelet (LSW) processes, which model both stationary and some kinds of non-stationary processes. Analysis of time-series assuming the LSW model permits identification of an evolutionary wavelet spectrum (EWS) that quantifies the variation in a time-series over a particular scale and at a particular time. We address estimation of the EWS and show how our methodology reveals phenomena of interest in an infant electrocardiogram series. },

We show how the EWS may be rigorously estimated by a smoothed wavelet periodogram and how both these quantities may be inverted to provide an estimable time-localized autocovariance.

The manner in which the Markovian model can be used to generate wind speed time series are also described. Using the transition probability matrix developed from the real wind data, the synthetic wind speed time series are generated.

  Abstract                 = {A better understanding of natural climate variability is crucial for global climate change studies and the evaluation of the sensitivity of the climate system to imposed perturbations. External forcing factors might contribute substantially to both high and low frequency variations in climate but a clear separation of their impact from internally generated fluctuations is difficult. We employ wavelet decomposition to identify common characteristics in forcing and climatic time series of the last four centuries. Here, we focus on solar irradiance variations by applying this statistical method to a selection of widely used proxy-based reconstructions. Major variability components are isolated through time-scale decomposition. Two classical solar modes (85 and 11 years) are not only identified within the limited time period covered by the solar datasets, but their relative influences on climate as represented by hemispheric surface temperature reconstructions are also estimated. While the low-frequency component shows close ties between solar variations and surface climate, a relationship between the 11-year sunspot cycle and temperature reconstructions is more difficult to attribute. However, the statistical multi-resolution analysis appears to be an ideal tool to uncover relationships and their changes at different temporal scales normally hidden by the strong background noise in the climate system.

For such hours, averaging over the hour will imply smoothing of quite significant variations within the hour. Models for the probability density distributions of short-term (5 min or less) irradiances are presented in this paper. These distributions are not unique functions of the hourly averages, but depend heavily also on the irradiance variability within the hour. This intrahour variability is found to depend on the averaging time and also on the interhour variability among three hourly averages, namely, the hour in question, the preceding and the deceding hour. The distribution differences between 5 rain averages and instantaneous values are, however, negligible for most practical purposes. The lag one autocorrelation is evaluated as a function of averaging time, and a first order autoregressive model is presented. With hourly averages as the only input the probability density and autoregressive model in combination produce time series of short-term intrahour averages having realistic distributions and autocorrelation structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultra-high frequency (UHF) systems are well established for monitoring partial discharges (PD) in gas-insulated substations (GIS) and are increasingly being used on power transformers. Different sensor designs such as disk sensors, spiral sensors, monopoles and dipoles have been used depending on the application. A primary concern is to ensure that the sensitivity of these different sensors can meet the CIGRE requirement for detecting 5 pC partial discharges GIS. Recent work on locating PD in power transformers has focused attention on recording the arrival time of the received UHF signal, which is important for locating insulation defects in three dimensions. An accuracy of 1 ns or better is desirable for time-of-flight measurements to locate a PD source. In some situations, a clear arrival time for the signal can be identified but in other cases the arrival time can be uncertain within a tolerance of several nanoseconds. Therefore, a number of sensors were tested for their speed of response using a transient calibration system. Results suggest that more complex sensor structures have a slower build-up of energy at their output, while simple sensors exhibit less of a 'blurring' effect on the leading edge of the signal. },

  Abstract                 = {The public support in photovoltaic (PV) technologies and increasing markets have resulted in extensive applications of grid-connected PV, in particular in the consumer side and electricity distribution grid. In this paper, the effects of a high level of grid connected PV in the middle voltage distribution network have been analyzed. The emphasis is put on static phenomena, including voltage drop, network losses and grid benefits. A multi-purpose modeling tool is used for PV analysis in Lisbon and Helsinki climates. All network types studied can handle PV without problems with an amount of PV equaling at least up to the load (1kWp/household). The comb-type network showed the best performance. The PV is unable to shave the domestic load peak in the early evening hours but through orientating the PV panels both to east and west, the noon peak from PV can be reduced by 30%. PV integration reduces network losses positively up to a 1kWp/hh (100% of annual domestic load) level. For 2 kWp/hh all but the comb-type networks demonstrate clear over-voltage situations and the annual network losses are much higher than without PV.},

  Abstract                 = {Electricity consumption data profiles that include details on the consumption can be generated with a bottom-up load models. In these models the load is constructed from elementary load components that can be households or even their individual appliances. In this work a simplified bottom-up model is presented. The model can be used to generate realistic domestic electricity consumption data on an hourly basis from a few up to thousands of households. The model uses input data that is available in public reports and statistics. Two measured data sets from block houses are also applied for statistical analysis, model training, and verification. Our analysis shows that the generated load profiles correlate well with real data. Furthermore, three case studies with generated load data demonstrate some opportunities for appliance level demand side management (DSM). With a mild DSM scheme using cold loads, the daily peak loads can be reduced 7.2% in average. With more severe DSM schemes the peak load at the yearly peak day can be completely levelled with 42% peak reduction and sudden 3 h loss of load can be compensated with 61% mean load reduction.},

  Abstract                 = {This edition continues the practice of updating its contents to reflect changes affecting electric distribution systems. It continues its original role of providing information in a non or semi technical manner to persons working on such systems enabling them to perform their duties in an enlightened way. This contributes not only to a greater quality of production, but more importantly, with greater safety to themselves and the general public, the consumers they serve. While the effects of deregulation have been more pronounced on the generation and transmission components of the supply chain, it has also had an impact on the distribution system with its cogeneration and distributed generation features. Improvement in materials and methods continue to contribute to the economic and environmental betterment enjoyed by consumers. Predominant among these include the gradual replacement of heavier porcelain insulators with polymer (plastic) ones, the employment of insulated bucket vehicles making climbing with the use of spikes a lost art. Improvements in âsolidâ type insulation in cables, and more efficient machinery for placing them underground. Thus narrowing the economic differences between overhead and underground installations. The distribution system is the most visible part of the supply chain, and as such the most exposed to the critical observation of its users. It is, in many cases, the largest investment, maintenance and operation expense, and the object of interest to government, financial agencies, and âwatch dogâ associations of concerned citizens. As such, the desirability of knowing how and why it is so constituted becomes obvious. Distribution systems have also been affected by deregulation, although not in the same manner as transmission systems, Figure P-1 (opposite). Where additional transmission or generation was not available or too great an expense to supply some additional loads, Distributed Generation made its entry on Distribution Systems. Here, small generating units usually powered by small gas turbines (although other units such as wind powered, solar, fuel cells, etc. may be involved) are connected to the system as are cogeneration units, both with possible hazard to safety. These notes were begun in the early 1940âs as classroom material, part of a rapid training program for line personnel. The program was highly successful, reflected in greater safety and production among other benefits, and achieved national attention. Once again, our thanks to our old friends, Ken Smalling and The Fairmont Press for their help and support},

All new GIS in the UK are fitted with internal couplers for UHF monitoring, and two examples of continuous monitoring schemes on 400 kV GIS at nuclear power stations are described. Further developments, which are already well advanced, include specifying and measuring the coupler characteristics, making use of expert systems to interpret the UHF discharge data, and extending the monitoring system to include the performance of circuit breakers and other equipment. },

  Abstract                 = {A new, more accurate and considerably simpler version of the Perez[1] diffuse irradiance model is presented. This model is one of those used currently to estimate short time step (hourly or less) irradiance on tilted planes based on global and direct (or diffuse) irradiance. It has been shown to perform more accurately than other models for a large number of locations worldwide. The key assumptions defining the model remain basically unchanged. These include (1) a description of the sky dome featuring a circumsolar zone and horizon zone superimposed over an isotropic background, and (2) a parameterization of insolation conditions (based on available inputs to the model), determining the value of the radiant power originating from these two zones. Operational modifications performed on the model are presented in a step by step approach. Each change is justified on the basis of increased ease of use and/or overall accuracy. Two years of hourly data on tilted planes from two climatically distinct sites in France are used to verify performance accuracy. The isotropic, Hay and Klucher models are used as reference. Major changes include (1) the simplification of the governing equation by use of reduced brightness coefficients; (2) the allowance for negative coefficients; (3) reduction of the horizon band to an arc-of-great-circle; (4) optimization of the circumsolar region width; and (5) optimization of insolation conditions parameterization.},

  Abstract                 = {A model is described to estimate hourly or higher frequency diffuse sky radiation impinging on plane surfaces of any orientation, once knowing this value on the horizontal. This model features a simple geometrical sky hemisphere description, allowing for the observed effects of forward-scattered and back-scattered radiation and a parameterization of insolation conditions based on available radiative quantities. Model performance is studied through (1) long term independent tests performed against hourly ground-shielded tilted irradiance data from Trappes, France; Carpentras, France and San Antonio, Texas; (2) long term dependent tests performed against hourly data from the same stations plus Albany, New York; and (3) real time tests based on one-minute data from Albany, New York. Performance is assessed through comparison with three reference models: the isotropic, the Hay, and Klucher anisotropic models. Substantial performance improvement over the three reference models is found for all stations and all surface orientations. Additional performance improvements from independent to dependent testing can be explained logically on the basis of climate, altitude and latitude differences between stations.},

  Abstract                 = {Las medidas legislativas que han entrado en vigor en nuestro país en los últimos años han supuesto el caldo de cultivo para que los Sistemas Fotovoltaicos de Conexión a Red (SFCR) hayan dejado de ser productos meramente energéticos y de marcado carácter medioambiental para transformarse en productos de indudable atractivo desde el punto de vista económico. La combinación entre gran potencia de sistemas, primas a la venta de energía y fuerte capitalización inicial del sistema han provocado la entrada de entidades bancarias en numerosos proyectos. La figura más frecuentemente utilizada en la financiación es el denominado project finance, que consiste básicamente en saldar las deudas de capital e intereses mediante los ingresos por energía generada. La energía producida por un sistema fotovoltaico a lo largo de un determinado periodo puede ser estimada a partir de valores históricos de la radiación incidente en el lugar donde se ubica el SFCR, asumiendo el conocimiento de ciertas características básicas del sistema en estudio. Debido al carácter intrínsecamente aleatorio de la radiación solar, la pregunta âÂ¿cuánto genera un SFCR en este lugar en los próximos años?â implica un ejercicio de predicción inevitablemente sometido a un cierto grado de incertidumbre. A partir de lo aprendido de una revisión del estado del arte en cuanto a tratamiento de la radiación y estimación de la energía, en este documento se presenta un método de estimación, denominado Método de los Momentos Estadísticos, que será sometido a validación contra datos de operación real de dos SFCR. A continuación, se empleará este método para discutir acerca de la complejidad que un modelo de radiación necesita en una estimación de producción de energía anual. El concepto de un SFCR como un producto de inversión con rentabilidad ha acelerado el desarrollo de múltiples soluciones de seguimiento. Esta búsqueda en pos de incrementar la productividad de los SFCR tiene una contrapartida: en general, cuanto más exacto es el método de seguimiento, menos eficiente es su aprovechamiento de terreno debido a sombras mutuas entre seguidores cercanos. En este documento se desarrollan un conjunto de ecuaciones para modelar el comportamiento de las diferentes técnicas de seguimiento. Este primer paso servirá para generar estimaciones de energía producida por cada uno de ellos, que serán recogidas en mapas y gráficas comparativas de productividad. A continuación se analizará el impacto de las sombras mutuas entre seguidores, para generar herramientas de decisión que permitan definir las separaciones entre seguidores, como un compromiso entre ocupación de terreno y energía producida. Por último, el estudio de un SFCR se cierra analizando su capacidad para devolver la energía que ha sido empleada para fabricarlo y hacerlo funcionar. Este análisis de ciclo de vida restringido al comportamiento energético se aplica a sistemas estáticos, de eje horizontal y doble eje, generando mapas de tiempo de retorno energético, como una herramienta más de decisión entre diferentes alternativas tecnológicas.},

We need methods for calculating the reduced irradiance to minimize the shading losses in the planning process. There are well-known models to estimate the irradiance received by a tilted surface. However, these methods normally do not include shading reduction caused by objects in the surroundings. Therefore, methods are proposed to include shading in calculations of direct and diffuse irradiation. Before these methods can be used, the surroundings have to be surveyed. Hence, how to survey objects in an easy way is discussed. Using the proposed methods and calculations it is possible to include shading reduction in the prediction of the irradiance on a tilted surface. Finally, the influence of shading on the irradiance is shown by an example.},

  Abstract                 = {The influence of climatic and geometric variables on the hourly diffuse fraction has been studied, based on a data set with 22,000 hourly measurements from five European and North American locations. The goal is to determine if other predictor variables, in addition to the clearness index, will significantly reduce the standard error of Liu- and Jordan-type correlations (ld/l = f(kt)). Stepwise regression is used to reduce a set of 28 potential predictor variables down to four significant predictors: the clearness index, solar altitude, ambient temperature, and relative humidity. A piecewise correlation over three ranges of clearness indices is developed to predict the diffuse fraction as a function of these four variables. A second piecewise correlation is developed for predicting the diffuse fraction as a function of the clearness index and solar altitude, for use when temperature and relative humidity are not available. A third piecewise correlation of the Liu- and Jordan-type is developed from the same data set. Comparing this correlation with the new correlations provides a direct measure of the value of added predictor variables. The full diffuse fraction correlation reduced the residual sum squares by 14% when compared to the correlation that is a function of the clearness index only. The correlation including the clearness index and solar altitude diminished the residual sum squares by 9%. The correlations exhibited some degree of location dependence. This is expected, as the climates are quite different. The correlations also showed some seasonal dependence; the errors are higher in the fall and winter than on an annual basis.},

  Abstract                 = {The heliostat field layout is an essential task for any solar tower plant optimization process. Radially staggered and other distributions are usually optimised by computer codes using different approaches. In most of those cases, due to the CPU time required, the heliostat field layout is optimised by several mathematical models and simplifications. With todays computers, it is possible to calculate the yearly energy available at any point in a site for a given tower height, the yearly normalized energy surface (YNES). Yearly efficiency maps can be generated based on the cosine factor, the spillage factor and the atmospheric attenuation coefficient of the site using real Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) data, within a reasonable computing time. It is therefore easy to find the place where the yearly energy available is the highest for location of the first heliostat. It is also possible to calculate the effect of shadowing and blocking by this heliostat on the YNES, so YNES can be re-calculated and the best position for the next heliostat can be found. Although this iterative method is time-consuming, it is worthwhile if either the efficiency of the solar plant can be increased or the capital cost reduced. This YNES-based layout generation method enables better flexibility than pre-determined gridding strategies such as used in DELSOL. The paper includes a description of the optimization procedure},

The largest benefit from this glass, however, is obtained when rays arrive to the front module surface at low incident angles. In this case a power increase of over 15% can be measured, at the early morning and evening hours. Overall, this is translated in an increase in a measured daily energy output of more than 3%, which is a substantial gain in terms of electricity production per module. The benefit can be even larger in installations where the inclination of the module is not optimal as, for instance, on fa\c cades. The long-term performance of modules with structured glass has been evaluated in an outdoor monitoring station, showing no accumulation of dust in the glass features even after long periods with complete absence of rains in southern Spain.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a comparative study of three high-accuracy frequency estimation methods for application in vibration analysis of rotating machinery. The first two techniques are non-parametric methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) : the interpolated fast Fourier transform (IFFT) and the iterative weighted phase averager (IWPA). The third method is a parametric high-resolution technique known as ESPRIT. The FFT-based methods combine techniques to reduce the effects of windowing with an iterative procedure which, at each iteration, detects the strongest peak and subtracts its effect (to reduce the interference resulting from spectral leakage). The paper compares their variance, resolution and computational requirements by means of simulation examples and also using end winding vibration data taken from a hydroelectric turbogenerator. It is found that, in situations with a moderate or high level of spectral interference, the IWPA method outperforms the IFFT and is even competitive with ESPRIT. Moreover, the IWPA has the ability to separate sinusoids more closely spaced than the periodogram's resolution limit. The IFFT method, on the other hand, has the lowest computational cost. },

  Abstract                 = {Converter transformers are one of the key components in high voltage DC power networks. The insulation of these transformers is stressed by both AC and DC voltages. Therefore, AC and DC voltage tests are routinely applied during factory tests to verify the performance of the insulation structure. Partial discharges in an insulation system are incipient discharges that can damage materials and may eventually lead to complete failure of the insulation system during operation. Recently it has been shown that monitoring such discharges formed under AC stress is feasible using Ultra High Frequency (UHF) measurement technique and that there is a reasonable correlation between the partial discharge magnitude and the amplitude of the UHF signal generated by partial discharges. However,the partial discharge activity under DC voltages is not fully understood. This paper describes a study using the UHF technique to improve our understanding of particle-induced partial discharge activity under DC voltages in mineral oil insulation. UHF signals generated due to conducting particle contamination in transformer oil under AC and DC voltages are compared and analyzed. A method for distinguishing particle discharges in regions of high or low electric field stress is proposed based on frequency-domain analysis of the measured UHF signal. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {In comparison to standard applications, lifetimes of leadÂ±acid batteries in photovoltaic (PV) systems are shorter than one might expect. This investigation aims to identify reasons for the accelerated ageing. A detailed mathematical model of current, potential and acid distribution within the electrodes during normal operation is developed and used. Results show that the rather small currents in PV applications (on an average between I50 and I100) and the limited charging time cause problems, which are of minor relevance for standard applications. Small currents in conjunction with acid stratiÂ®cation cause a signiÂ®cant undercharging of the lower part of the electrodes, which again causes accelerated sulphation. Further, the number of sulphate crystals decreases with decreasing discharge current used for a full charge of the battery. This reduces the overall surface of the sulphate crystals and results in higher polarisation during the charging. The time taken for a battery cell to be completely charged is dominated by the positive electrode because it shows a high polarisation well before the electrode is completely charged. Simulations show that the charging time could be reduced if positive electrodes with less inner surface were to be used in batteries for PV systems. It is worth mentioning that the requirements for power are rather small in PV systems. This paper focuses on the qualitative results of the simulations and their interpretation. No models are explained in detail.},

  Abstract                 = {Predicting the lifetime of lead-acid batteries in applications with irregular operating conditions such as partial state-of-charge cycling, varying depth-of-discharge and different times between full charging is known as a difficult task. Experimental investigations in the laboratory are difficult because each application has its own specific operation profile. Therefore, an experimental investigation is necessary for each application and, moreover, for each operation strategy. This paper presents a lifetime model that allows comparison of the impact of different operating conditions, different system sizing and different battery technologies on battery lifetime. It is a tool for system designers and system operators to select appropriate batteries, to do a proper system design (sizing of the battery, power generators and loads), and to implement an optimized operation strategy (end-of-charge voltage, frequency of full charging, gassing periods, maximum depth-of-discharge). The model is a weighted Ah throughput approach based on the assumption that operating conditions are typically more severe than those used in standard tests of cycling and float lifetime. The wear depends on the depth-of-discharge, the current rate, the existing acid stratification, and the time since the last full charging. The actual Ah throughput is continuously multiplied by a weight factor that represents the actual operating conditions. Even though the modelling approach is mainly heuristic, all of the effects that are taken into account are based on a detailed analysis and understanding of ageing processes in lead-acid batteries. The ânormalâ user can adapt the model to different battery types simply from the data sheet information on cycle lifetime and float lifetime.},

  Abstract                 = {The long lifetime and high intensity of vortex trails generated by landing large-capacity aircraft may cause a risk to subsequently landing planes. A wake vortex warning system can help to avoid such hazards by forecasting the time intervals permitting safe operation on the landing strip. This information provides the basis for an appropriate landing schedule based on reduced succession distances. An essential element of the warning system is the prediction of wind across the landing strip and this is commonly determined by a method based on the principle of persistence. This study shows that autoregressive (AR) modelling can improve the accuracy of crosswind forecasts. To this end, the measurements are analysed in order to estimate model parameters. Unlike the more simplistic previously used method, AR forecasting, as part of the vortex trail warning system, allows longer intervals for safe operation and can avoid forecast discontinuities (leaps) which are inherent problems of all forecasts in which boundary layer processes have to be considered.},

We derive and justify a decomposition of the usual cross-covariance in terms of scale-by-scale wavelet cross-covariances, and describe estimators of both quantities along with asymptotic equivalences. The scale-by-scale decomposition of autocovariance and cross-covariance sequences are illustrated via a simulation study. A detailed scale analysis of the surface albedo and temperature of pack ice in the Beaufort Sea shows that the differing resolutions of the two sensors can be seen in the wavelet cross-correlations and autocorrelations at small scales, while at larger scales correlation patterns emerged suggesting fractal-like behaviour over a range of scales. },

  Abstract                 = {Many physical processes are an amalgam of components operating on different scales, and scientific questions about observed data are often inherently linked to understanding the behavior at different scales. We explore time-scale properties of time series through the variance at different scales derived using wavelet methods. The great advantage of wavelet methods over ad hoc modifications of existing techniques is that wavelets provide exact scale-based decomposition results. We consider processes that are stationary, nonstationary but with stationary dth order differences, and nonstationary but with local stationarity. We study an estimator of the wavelet variance based on the maximal-overlap (undecimated) discrete wavelet transform. The asymptotic distribution of this wavelet variance estimator is derived for a wide class of stochastic processes, not necessarily Gaussian or linear. The variance of this distribution is estimated using spectral methods. Simulations confirm the theoretical results. The utility of the methodology is demonstrated on two scientifically important series, the surface albedo of pack ice (a strongly non-Gaussian series) and ocean shear data (a nonstationary series).},

The problem is examined initially for the univariate case, and is extended to include additional meteorological parameters in the process of estimating the optimum model. The results indicate that the developed artificial intelligence models predict the solar radiation time series more effectively compared to the conventional procedures based on the clearness index. The forecasting ability of some models can be further enhanced with the use of additional meteorological parameters.},

Typical examples of this type are the simulation, for the purpose of shaker test, of a multivariate process representing six components of the acceleration (due to, for example, a booster engine cutoff) measured at the base of a spacecraft and the simulation of horizontal and vertical components of earthquake acceleration. A homogeneous multidimensional process can also be simulated in terms of the sum of cosine functions with random frequencies and random phase angles. Examples of multidimensional processes considered here include the horizontal component f_o (t,x) of the wind velocity perpendicular to the axis (x axis) of a slender structure, the vertical gust velocity field f_o(x,y) frozen in space, and the boundary layer pressur field f_o(x,y,t). Also, a convenient use of the present method of simulation in a class of non-linear structural vibration analysis is described with a numerical example.},

In this method the field is divided into certain groups to increase the efficient use of land. The method is a simple one when compared to cell-wise procedures, making it more suitable for preliminary design of heliostat fields. At the same time, the method can be represented by a set of mathematical equations, consequently facilitating its computer implementation. In this paper a mathematical formulation of the method will be introduced, as well as its algorithm. Also, a criterion for the transfer to a new heliostat group is proposed based on mirror density.},

Thus, the objective of this study was to forecast the power production of a 1-MW photovoltaic power plant in Kitakyushu, Japan, using a new methodology based on support vector machines and on the use of several numerically predicted weather variables, including cloudiness. Hourly forecasts of the power produced for 1 year were carried out. Moreover, the effect of the use of numerically predicted cloudiness on the quality of the forecasts was also investigated. The forecasts of power production obtained with the proposed methodology had a root mean square error of 0.0948 MW h and a mean absolute error of 0.058 MW h. It was also found that the forecast and measured values of power production had a good level of correlation varying from 0.8 to 0.88 according to the season of the year. Finally, the use of numerically predicted cloudiness had an important role in the accuracy of the forecasts, and when cloudiness was not used, the root mean square error of the forecasts increased more than 32%, and the mean absolute error increased more than 42%.

This has spurred a renewed interest in carbon free or carbon neutral technologies for converting sources of renewable primary energy to electricity and to transportation fuels. However, it takes energy to produce energy, even when the primary source is energetically cost free, such as solar or wind. The aim of this letter is to present a model which allows the simulation of the energy costs of the deployment of a new energy technology. We show that the new technology may actually be an energy sink, instead of an energy source, relative to the global total primary energy supply (TPES) for many years or decades, depending on its intrinsic energy costs and deployment path, even though stated aims for its gross energy output are achieved. As expected, the energy payback time of the conversion devices, as well as fuel and maintenance costs are critical parameters. We illustrate the general model with simulations of the deployment of photovoltaic electricity, at global and national levels.},

The modules electrical performance was determined according to the standards IEC 60891 and the IEC 60904 series, electrical insulation tests were performed according to the recent IEC 61215 edition 2. Many manufacturers currently give a double power warranty for their products, typically 90% of the initial maximum power after 10 years and 80% of the original maximum power after 25 years. Applying the same criteria (taking into account modules electrical performance only and assuming 2 5% measurement uncertainty of a testing lab) only 17 6% of modules failed (35 modules out of 204 tested). Remarkably even if we consider the initial warranty period i.e. 10% of Pmax after 10 years, more than 65 7% of modules exposed for 20 years exceed this criteria. The definition of life time is a difficult task as there does not yet appear to be a fixed catastrophic failure point in module ageing but more of a gradual degradation. Therefore, if a system continues to produce energy which satisfies the user need it has not yet reached its end of life. If we consider this level arbitrarily to be the 80% of initial power then all indications from the measurements and observations made in this paper are that the useful lifetime of solar modules is not limited to the commonly assumed 20 year.},

A general conclusion is that the Glover and McCulloch model, the Gopinathan model, and the Page model perform the worst. Taking into account published reports, this was not expected for Pageâs and Gopinathanâs models. If results for the MBE and the RMSE obtained using data for all stations together are used to establish a ranking of the models, Rietveldâs monthly specific model and Doniaux and Lemoineâs monthly independent model perform the best. The last-mentioned model is latitude dependent, and valid for stations between 4âN and 61âN. The results obtained are encouraging relating its use for latitudes/geographical regions different from those used in this work. In any case it should not be neglected in possible future statistical comparisons, as it has been up to now.},

  Abstract                 = {This study assesses the pollutant emission offset potential of distributed grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) power systems. Computer-simulated performance results were utilized for 214 PV systems located across the US. The PV systems monthly electrical energy outputs were based on a performance calculator called PVWATTS. Offset emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) were determined from PV system outputs and average utility emissions data from each state. For validation, the simulated monthly results were statistically compared with measurement-based data (both production and corresponding emissions data) from 29 PV systems installed at different sites across the US. While the data shows high (geographic) variability, the substantial number of measurements allows reliable statistical analysis. The methods are found to give consistent results in spite of the necessity to employ some even quite crude input approximationsâsuch as the use of statewide rather than specific emissions data for the systems. No significant differences between simulated and measured monthly means for any of the pollutants were noted on the basis of individual monthly analyses, though the results for NOx suggest the possible existence of some difference in that case. A more detailed statistical modeling using all monthly data in one combined analysis (allowing improved variability estimation) confirms these conclusions. Even the shorter confidence intervals for expected offsets obtained through the combined analysis show no significant differences between simulated and measured methods for SO2 and CO2. The differences for NOx are statistically significant but consistentâsuggesting useful prediction by the simulations via a constant correction factor. As expected, significant differences between months are evident for both simulated and measured offsets.},

It is recommended that the t-statistic be used in conjunction with the root mean square and mean bias errors to more reliably assess a model?s performance.

However, marine system models are increasingly used for prediction to support high-stakes decision-making. In such applications it is imperative that a rigorous model skill assessment is conducted so that the model?s capabilities are tested and understood. Herein, we review several metrics and approaches useful to evaluate model skill. The definition of skill and the determination of the skill level necessary for a given application is context specific and no single metric is likely to reveal all aspects of model skill. Thus, we recommend the use of several metrics, in concert, to provide a more thorough appraisal. The routine application and presentation of rigorous skill assessment metrics will also serve the broader interests of the modeling community, ultimately resulting in improved forecasting abilities as well as helping us recognize our limitations.},

Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables.RESULTS:We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure.CONCLUSION:The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach.},

The fluctuation of instantaneous and short-time integrated radiation has been shown to differ significantly from that of daily insolation. This paper presents utilizability curves constructed from the cumulative probability distribution of instantaneous terrestrial insolation values. It is shown that hourly and daily utilizability curves give a conservative estimate of long-term performance. Experimental measurements of the collector performance further suggest the use of instantaneous utilizability curves in place of daily curves.

A model for the instantaneous diffuse fraction is developed, which describes the generation and transmission of diffuse solar radiation in the atmosphere.

Daily sums of global horizontal irradiation are considered for 18 years in the period 1985-2004. Standard deviation of yearly sums of global horizontal irradiation shows low interannual variability, being mostly in the range of 4% to 6%. While in arid climate of Northern Africa, Middle East, and Southern Europe standard deviation goes below 4%, values up to 10% are identified along coasts and in mountains. In the least sunny year out of 18, the solar resource was generally never more than 9% below the long-term average, and only in a few regions the radiation deficit reached 15%. The most stable weather is found in summer with standard deviation in June below 12%. The least stable season is winter, with variability higher then 20% in December, and regionally going above 35%. The solar resource has distinctive time and geographical patterns that might affect financing of large photovoltaic systems, as well as management of the distributed electricity generation.},

  Abstract                 = {Solar energy is the main driver of all natural processes on the Earth surface. It is an important input parameter into many environmental, ecological and risk-simulation models as the surface energy budget has large impact on evaporation, photosynthesis and heating processes occurring at the land surface and is highly dependent on the terrain. Vegetation biodiversity and biomass production are also related to radiation input. The Sun is also an abundant and inexhaustible source of energy that is available everywhere on the planet and still is exploited in a minimum way. Around the turn of the century, the energy technologies exploiting solar radiation began to receive high attention as they were recognised as one of alternatives to the conventional energy systems based on fossil fuels. It is generally accepted that solar energy systems generating heat and electricity can help to mitigate global problems, such as climate change, poverty in the developing world and insufficient security of energy supply in most of the world economies. Solar energy impinging on the Earth surface is spatially and temporally variable with a strong systematic dynamics but also with a stochastic component. With an exponential growth of energy applications, the knowledge of the primary resource has to be significantly improved. New models are being developed, where spatially distributed data integrated within a geographical information system (GIS) are needed. A new generation of digital elevation models (DEM) based on satellite data play an important role in the developed algorithms. The GIS-integrated solar radiation data can be further effectively used in technical and socioeconomic assessments. The aim of this chapter is to outline the basic principles of solar radiation modelling within the GIS with an emphasis on the role of DEM.},

This study does not identify the best database, but in a relative cross-comparison it points out to the areas of higher variability of outputs. Two maps are calculated to show an average of the yearly irradiation for horizontal surface together with the standard deviation that illustrates the combined effect of differences between the databases at the regional level. Differences at the local level are analysed on a set of 37 randomly selected points: global irradiation is calculated from subset of databases for southwards inclined (at 34Â°) and 2-axis tracking surfaces. Differences at the regional level indicate that within 90% of the study area the uncertainty of yearly global irradiation estimates (expressed by standard deviation) does not exceed 7% for horizontal surface, 8.3% for surface inclined at 34Â°, and 10% for 2-axis tracking surface. Higher differences in the outputs from the studied databases are found in complex climate conditions of mountains, along some coastal zones and in areas where solar radiation modelling cannot rely on sufficient density and quality of input data.},

This paper presents some easy-to-use tables addressed to estimate the IRR avoiding cumbersome calculations, which is an attractive feature for owners, marketers and designers. Firstly, current and near-term costs of PVGCS are reviewed, together with some financial incentives available at present. This introduces the economic scenario, where the tables are to be used. A short introduction to the economic analysis of these systems provides a solid ground to eventually present the tables intended to the estimation of the IRR.

The major unpredictable factor in defining the solar irradiance and the performance of solar systems is the presence of clouds in the sky. So far, various researchers proposed several models for estimating solar irradiance in correlation with cloud coverage and cloud type. This paper reviews the up-to-date research in automatic cloud detection and classification. It initiates with a brief introduction to clouds types and classification. Then, a detailed description of the equipment used for the measurements is provided, either ground based or satellite integrated. Finally, it concludes with an analysis of the existing algorithms for cloud classification, including a presentation of the up-to-date experimental results.},

The uncertainty in wind generation is very largely due to the inherent variability in wind speed, and this needs to be understood by operators of power systems and wind farms. To assist with the management of this risk, this paper investigates methods for predicting the probability density function of generated wind power from one to 10 days ahead at five UK wind farm locations. These density forecasts provide a description of the expected future value and the associated uncertainty. We construct density forecasts from weather ensemble predictions, which are a relatively new type of weather forecast generated from atmospheric models. We also consider density forecasting from statistical time series models. The best results for wind power density prediction and point forecasting were produced by an approach that involves calibration and smoothing of the ensemble-based wind power density.},

Examples are given showing that the diagram can be used to summarize the relative merits of a collection of different models or to track changes in performance of a model as it is modified. Methods are suggested for indicating on these diagrams the statistical significance of apparent differences, and the degree to which observational uncertainty and unforced internal variability limit the expected agreement between model-simulated and observed behaviors. The geometric relationship between the statistics plotted on the diagram also provides some guidance for devising skill scores that appropriately weight among the various measures of pattern correspondence.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper provides essentially a summary of PD measurements applying the UHF range in order to increase the detection threshold, to improve the localization accuracy and to perform on-line measurements of Partial Discharge (PD) in noisy environments. The electromagnetic URF technique offers good signal to noise ratios, because external PD signals and disturbances can be shielded effectively. A new developed method allows the localization of PD in gas-insulated substations (GIS) by frequency domain measurements. The basic idea is the displacement law of Fourier transformation. The interference phenomena of superposed signals from two sensors give information about the time delay of the sensor signals. On-site PD measurements are made at cable connectors by means of monopole antennas housed in a barrel sleave, while the cable is in service. Thus a sensitive PD measurement even in noisy environment is possible. PD-measurements on several 72 kV cable connectors were performed in an unshielded laboratory. On-site measurements during operation showed the great potential for condition assessment. For decoupling sensitive UHF PD signals from the inner of a power transformer tank UHF sensors applied through drain/oil valves are used. Experimental studies indicate that all relevant types of PD possibly occurring within a transformer emit high frequency spectra to be detected with UHF sensors. Furthermore in laboratory experiments and on-site measurements very moderate UHF signal attenuations have been observed. },

The goal of this research was to develop a methodology for estimating the uncertainty in PV yield predictions and to identify avenues for reducing this uncertainty. In this case study, uncertainties were estimated to be about 3.9% for year-to-year climate variability, 5% for long-term average horizontal insolation, 3% for estimation of radiation in the plane of the array, 3% for power rating of modules, 2% for losses due to dirt and soiling, 1.5% for losses due to snow and 5% for other sources of error. Uncertainties due to ageing and system availability were also considered. By performing statistical simulations with the Solar Advisor Model software, it was found that the combined uncertainty (standard deviation) is approximately 8.7% for the first year of operation, and 7.9% for the average yield over the PV system lifetime. While these numbers could vary significantly from one system to the next, the methodology developed is widely applicable. Moreover, a simpler methodology was also explored which should yield quick and fairly reliable estimates of uncertainty. Finally, avenues for reducing yield uncertainties were identified, including: increasing the reliability and resolution of solar radiation estimates, including measurements of irradiance in non-horizontal planes at high quality ground stations, reducing the uncertainty in module ratings and investigating losses that have not been well documented such as those due to dirt, soiling and snow.},

  Abstract                 = {The research investigated the impact on the power system with a large penetration of photovoltaic (PV) generation. The characteristic of photovoltaic generation was first described. Its associated operating behaviour and associated control were explained. A model of PV generation suitable for studying its interactions with the power system was developed. The model of PV generation was built on the basis of experimental results. The results were used to validate the simulation results obtained from the PV generation model that was developed. The dynamic response of a PV generation system to rapid changes in irradiance was investigated. An aggregated model of grid-connected PV generation was built and it was used for simulating the integration of PV generation on a large-scale. Voltage control technique was investigated by simulation. The simulation results were carried out in order to mitigate the negative effects caused by rapid changes in irradiance. Different types of voltage control were investigated using once again, simulation. The dynamic responses of PV generation when subjected to faults were investigated. The responses of the PV generation to faults that occur in the power system were analysed using simulation results obtained with a dynamic model of a widely used dynamic test system. The simulation of the effect of the characteristics of PV generation, fault impedance, protection parameters of PV generation and fault clearing time were performed and discussed. The capability of the PV generator to provide frequency response for the power system using electronic control was studied. A new control technique was proposed and built in SimulinkTM. The way the control of PV generation can be modified to contribute to frequency response was described. The control technique was simulated and the results showed a significant improvement in frequency response.},

The distribution functions of these increments with respect to their magnitude and duration are investigated, as well the distribution functions of stable intervals during generally variable radiation.

The suggested procedure is to define the efficiency versus irradiance and temperature for a specific module, collect the local irradiance and temperature data, and combine the two mathematically, resulting in effective efficiency. Reasonable approximations simplify the process. The module performance ratio is defined to be the ratio of effective efficiency to that under standard test conditions. Variations of the order of 10% in this factor among manufacturers, primarily the result of the differences in effective series resistance and leakage conductance, are not unusual. A focus on these parameters that control the effective efficiency should provide a path to PV modules with improved field performance.},

The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovmoller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Nino3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index show significantly higher power during 1880-1920 and 1960-90, and lower power during 1920-60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance. The power Hovmoller of sea level pressure shows significant variations in 2-8-yr wavelet power in both longitude and time.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT The development of solar energy as a power source in the next few years requires reliable estimation of available solar energy resources. At local scales, topography is the most important factor in determining the distribution of solar radiation at the surface. Interpolation techniques are usually employed to estimate solar radiation where stations are not available, but their usefulness is limited where topography is an important source of variability. The use of satellite data and more recently of models based on techniques GIS, have contributed to solve this difficulty. In this work the usefulness of a digital elevation model (DEM) in providing topographic information for the estimation of solar radiation in areas of complex topography is analysed. Daily global radiation values were generated using the Solar Analyst software, which uses topographic information to generate radiation data. The generated data were compared with the experimental data obtained from 14 radiometric stations located within the Sierra Nevada Natural Park (southern Spain), an area of complex topography. Results show the usefulness of the topographic information derived from a DEM to estimate the solar radiation in areas of complex topography. Nevertheless, results depend on the DEM resolution and it is important that other factors, such as the albedo, should also be taken into account to obtain better estimates. },

  Abstract                 = {This thesis introduces a computer model for simulating worldwide deployment of wind and solar power technologies at high spatial and temporal resolution. The Spatiotemporally-Explicit Power and Transmission (SEXPOT) model integrates global meteorological, geophysical, and socioeconomic data to identify cost-minimizing strategies for utilizing available renewable resources. SEXPOT is unique, because it allows for low-cost, large-scale analyses while providing local-scale results. Model output includes the preferred locations for wind and solar power technologies and transmission lines and shows how variable power sources can be integrated with conventional technologies to meet demand hour-by-hour. NASA climate model output is used to predict the performance of onshore and offshore wind turbines and utility-scale and rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, and a statistical model is developed to predict the distribution of electricity consumption across space and time. Linear programming techniques are then used to optimize the deployment of generating technologies. This paper describes the development of model components and associated input data and demonstrates functionality with an illustrative model run. Application to a variety of research questions is explored and areas for model improvement identified. SEXPOT is presently a working prototype that, it is hoped, will be improved over time.},

  Abstract                 = {Following our early suggestion, numerous central receiver design codes have employed the radial-stagger (RS) configuration to automatically produce a map of heliostat locations. Few of these maps show sufficient attention to detail to well represent the optimized design. The University of Houston RCELL optimization process provides for each cell a specification of optimized energy/m2 of reflector, as well as radial spacing and azimuthal spacing. Several issues are involved in properly implementing the RS configuration to provide heliostat locations. Conflicts in the azimuthal spacing are handled by adjusting the radial spacing to maintain the optimal energy/m2 of reflector. Moving inward, extreme azimuthal crowding occurs. This is alleviated by the introduction of zone boundaries where the angular azimuthal spacing is increased by a factor such as 5/4. The 5th heliostat in the last circle is deleted to alleviate severe blocking. Then, nearby heliostats are âslippedâ to take advantage of the âholeâ. The Solar One field exemplifies this procedure, and was 97% as effective as an âeverywhere optimalâ field.},

  Abstract                 = {In wind turbine fatigue load calculations, it is customary to consider separate 10-minute periods, characterised by mean wind speed, mean wind direction and turbulence intensity. This approach misses large low frequency load cycles (with periods of a few hours or days) that may influence total fatigue loading. To remedy this, a Markov chain method is proposed that generates artificial long term wind and load histories. Comparisons of generated and measured wind speed histories are done. Using artificial wind speed histories, the expected amount of starts and stops is established, and the fatigue damage equivalent loads including large load cycles over the life of a standard turbine operating in an IEC class II wind regime. It is shown that the influence of low frequency load cycles on fatigue is significant.},

  Abstract                 = {Solar radiation data is essential to conducting performance analyses of solar energy systems. In the US, the National Solar Radiation data base has archived 30 years of hourly data for 239 US cities. Since the computational effort required to simulate systems for 30 years is excessive, it is more convenient to use typical meteorological year (TMY) data in performance analyses. TMY data provide hourly solar radiation and meteorological data representative of one âtypicalâ year for the same 239 locations in the database. Simulation studies have generally used these hourly values, although solar radiation can exhibit wide variations during an hour. Variations in solar radiation during an hour could result in inaccurate performance estimates for some types of solar systems, such as photovoltaic systems, that respond quickly and non-linearly to solar radiation. Short-term radiation data is not as readily available as hourly data. One year of 1- minute data for one US location and one year of 3-minute data for eight US locations were made available for this research. The impact of using short-term radiation data in performance analyses instead of hourly data and the accuracy of using statistically formulated TMY data instead of the actual long-term data was investigated. In addition, the behaviors of both data sets were studied in terms of diffuse fraction and frequency distributions. Correlations and distribution curves have been previously developed and comparisons of real data to these correlations were made to determine their accuracy. To quantify impacts, calculation of radiation on tilted surfaces using known models were made for both TMY data and short-term radiation data sets, and utilizability analyses were made to quantify the impact on performance analyses in a system-independent manner.},

In addition, diffuse fraction regressions and cumulative frequency distribution curves have been developed using hourly data and the accuracy of these regressions when applied to short-term radiation has not been established. The purpose of this research is to investigate the inaccuracies caused by using hourly rather than short-term (i.e., minute and 3 min) radiation data on the estimated performance of solar energy systems. The inaccuracies are determined by examination of the frequency distribution and diffuse fraction relationships for short-term solar radiation data as compared to existing regressions and by comparing calculated radiation on tilted surfaces and utilizability based on hourly and short-term radiation data.},

  Abstract                 = {This study investigates the influence of the short-term dynamics of daylight on simulation-based predictions of the annual daylight availability in a building. To this end annual indoor illuminance simulations are carried out for a two-person-office using the RADIANCE-based dynamic daylight simulation method DAYSIM. As of yet, all available daylight simulation methods are typically based on 1-h means of irradiance data and thus tend to neglect the short-term dynamics of daylight. In the first part of this study the dependence of the annual daylight availability on the underlying simulation time step interval is quantified. Assuming two different automated daylight-dependent artificial lighting strategies, the predicted annual artificial lighting demand is systematically underestimated by up to 27% on the simulations based on 1-h means instead of 1-min means of measured beam and diffuse irradiances. The general validity of these results is ensured by employing irradiance data from five stations world-wide. As measured 1-min means of irradiance data are generally not available for practical applications, the stochastic SkartveitâOlseth model, which generates 1-min means of irradiance data from hourly means, is adapted for daylight simulation purposes in the second part of this study. The utilization of modeled 1-min means of irradiance data reduces the above described systematic simulation errors to below 8% for both automated lighting strategies and all five stations. Accordingly, the modified version of the SkartveitâOlseth model is able to enhance the quality of dynamic daylight simulations â without any additional planning effort for the lighting designer.},

But now, with computers integrated into a wide variety of electronic products, the question of ac power quality is more critical than ever. The computer-based systems prevalent today can garble or lose data because of power-supply disturbances or interruptions. And if the operational problems are not enough, there is the usually difficult task of equipment troubleshooting and repair that follows a utility system fault.

  Abstract                 = {[1] We consider the problem of testing for homogeneity of variance in a time series with long memory structure. We demonstrate that a test whose null hypothesis is designed to be white noise can, in fact, be applied, on a scale by scale basis, to the discrete wavelet transform of long memory processes. In particular, we show that evaluating a normalized cumulative sum of squares test statistic using critical levels for the null hypothesis of white noise yields approximately the same null hypothesis rejection rates when applied to the discrete wavelet transform of samples from a fractionally differenced process. The point at which the test statistic, using a nondecimated version of the discrete wavelet transform, achieves its maximum value can be used to estimate the time of the unknown variance change. We apply our proposed test statistic on five time series derived from the historical record of Nile River yearly minimum water levels covering 622-1922 A. D., each series exhibiting various degrees of serial correlation including long memory. In the longest subseries, spanning 622-1284 A. D., the test confirms an inhomogeneity of variance at short time scales and identifies the change point around 720 A. D., which coincides closely with the construction of a new device around 715 A. D. for measuring the Nile River. The test also detects a change in variance for a record of only 36 years. },

  Abstract                 = {Multiscale analysis of univariate time series has appeared in the literature at an ever increasing rate. Here we introduce the multiscale analysis of covariance between two time series using the discrete wavelet transform. The wavelet covariance and wavelet correlation are defined and applied to this problem as an alternative to traditional cross-spectrum analysis. The wavelet covariance is shown to decompose the covariance between two stationary processes on a scale by scale basis. Asymptotic normality is established for estimators of the wavelet; covariance and correlation. Both quantities are generalized into the wavelet cross covariance and cross correlation in order to investigate possible lead/lag relationships. A thorough analysis of interannual variability for the Madden-Julian oscillation is performed using a 35+ year record of daily station pressure series. The time localization of the discrete wavelet transform allows the subseries, which are associated with specific physical time scales, to be partitioned into both seasonal periods (such as summer and winter) and also according to El Nine-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity, Differences in variance and correlation between these periods may then be firmly established through statistical hypothesis testing. The daily station pressure series used here show clear evidence of increased variance and correlation in winter across Fourier periods of 16-128 days, During warm episodes of ENSO activity, a reduced variance is observed across Fourier periods of 8-512 days for the station pressure series from Truk Island and little or no correlation between station pressure series for the same periods.},

  Abstract                 = {MRI time series experiments produce a wealth of information contained in two or three spatial dimensions that evolve over time. Such experiments can, for example, localize brain response to pharmacological stimuli, but frequently the spatiotemporal characteristics of the cerebral response are unknown a priori and variable, and thus difficult to evaluate using hypothesis-based methods alone. Here we used features in the temporal dimension to group voxels with similar time courses based on a nonparametric discrete wavelet transform (DWT) representation of each time course. Applying the DWT to each voxel decomposes its temporal information into coefficients associated with both time and scale. Discarding scales in the DWT that are associated with high-frequency oscillations (noise) provided a straight-foward data reduction step and decreased the computational burden. Optimization-based clustering was then applied to the remaining wavelet coefficients in order to produce a finite number of voxel clusters. This wavelet-based cluster analysis (WCA) was evaluated using two representative classes of MRI neuroimaging experiments. In perfusion-weighted MRI, following occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO), WCA differentiated healthy tissue and different regions within the ischemic hemisphere. Following an acute cocaine challenge, WCA localized subtle differences in the pharmacokinetic profile of the cerebral response. We conclude that WCA provides a robust method for blind analysis of time series image data. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Power fluctuations between the monitored time intervals of more than 5% of the installed power have disappeared. The analysed energy spectrum of the combined power generation reveals that the produced energy is generated in a range below 65% of the overall installed power.

  Abstract                 = {There are many models currently available which provide detailed information regarding the performance of PV modules. This paper reviews, as part of the European co-ordination action PV-Catapult, the different performance modelling approaches currently developed by European research institutions. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of modelling approaches available and define the inputs required for each model. This will be used to investigate the accuracy of these models for different European climatic conditions in a second stage of the project. All methods are reviewed, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of each. None of the methods consider temporal variations, such as degradation in the case of amorphous silicon. This paper investigates the impact this has on the year-to-year performance translation of such devices. Furthermore there is very little consideration of the incident spectrum, which affects wide band gap devices and multi-bandgap devices disproportionately, but this effect commonly is folded into irradiance and temperature effects. The implications of these are discussed based on current sales practice of quoting straight kWh/kWp, indicating the need for a better, technology independent comparator based on realistic energy production, rather than todayâs STC laboratory efficiency. The results indicate that most models can predict energy yield within 10%.},

Accelerated stress tests are then utilized to test new materials and processes before they are implemented in production. Long term module reliability is assessed using a three pronged approach. 1) A small number of modules have been deployed outdoors for long time periods with periodic measurements of performance in order to establish degradation rates. 2) Field returns are reviewed for both overall return rates and to identify the failure mechanism that caused the return. 3) Accelerated stress tests are utilized to evaluate the present products and all new materials, processes and designs against known failure mechanisms. The data from all three cases indicate that todayâs PV modules are extrememly reliable and have projected lifetimes well in excess of the warranties.},

  Abstract                 = {Solar radiation is characterized by short fluctuations introduced by passing clouds. An analysis of these fluctuations with regard to solar energy applications should focus on the instantaneous clearness index. Its probability distribution for a given mean clearness index is, as a first approximation, independent from the season and partly also from the site. This is verified for four annual datasets from three different sites. An analysis of fluctuations in solar radiation must focus on their amplitude, persistence, and frequency of occurrence rather than their location in time. The Fourier analysis cannot satisfactorily provide this information since time series of the instantaneous clearness index exhibit no periodicity. Instead, a localized spectral analysis based on wavelet bases rather than on periodic-ones has been applied. This analysis allows the decomposition of the fluctuating clearness index signal into a set of orthonormal subsignals. Each of them represents one specific scale of persistence of the fluctuation. The annual mean square values of all subsignals have been analysed, permitting the allocation of the signalâs power content to the different scales of persistence of a fluctuation. These annual mean values agree well for the different datasets, indicating the existence of statistically significant mean square values of the fluctuations as a function of their persistence. The analysis offers a valuable tool for the estimation of power flow fluctuations introduced by direct solar energy systems. With further elaboration it may be applied by power system operators for network planning in distribution grids with a high density of embedded generation.},

  Abstract                 = {Partial shadowing has been identified as a main cause for reducing energy yield of grid-connected photovoltaic systems. The impact of the applied system configuration on the energy yield of partially shadowed arrays has been widely discussed. Nevertheless, there is still much confusion especially regarding the optimal grade of modularity for such systems. A 5-kWp photovoltaic system was installed at K.U. Leuven. The system consists of three independent subsystems: central inverter, string inverter, and a number of AC modules. Throughout the year, parts of the photovoltaic array are shadowed by vegetation and other surrounding obstacles. The dimensions of shadowing obstacles were recorded and the expectable shadowing losses were estimated by applying different approaches. Based on the results of almost 2 years of analytical monitoring, the photovoltaic system is assessed with regard to shadowing losses and their dependence on the chosen system configuration. The results indicate that with obstacles of irregular shape being close to the photovoltaic array, simulation estimates the shadowing losses rather imprecise. At array positions mainly suffering from a reduction of the visible horizon by obstacles far away from the photovoltaic array, a simulation returns good results. Significant differences regarding shadow tolerance of different inverter types or overproportional losses with long module strings could not be confirmed for the system under examination. The negative impact of partial shadowing on the array performance should not be underestimated, but it affects modular systems as well as central inverter systems.},

Pseudo random time series of solar irradiance, based on measured values of instantaneous clearness index are applied as input data. Power flow calculations are carried out in order to assess the impact of fluctuating solar irradiance on the grid voltage. The ?fluctuation power index? is defined as a measure for the average frequency of occurrence of fluctuations of a specific persistence.

Three forecasting methods are proposed using different types of meteorological data as input parameters, namely, global horizontal irradiance (GHI), diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI), direct normal irradiance (DNI) and cloud cover. The first method directly uses GHI to forecast next hour GHI through additive seasonal decomposition followed by an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The second method forecasts DHI and DNI separately using additive seasonal decomposition followed by an ARIMA model and then combines the two forecasts to predict GHI using an atmospheric model. The third method considers cloud cover effects. An ARIMA model is used to predict cloud transients. GHI at different zenith angles and under different cloud cover conditions is constructed using nonlinear regression, i.e., we create a look-up table of GHI regression models for different cloud cover conditions. All three methods are tested using data from two weather stations in the USA: Miami and Orlando. It is found that forecasts using cloud cover information can improve the forecast accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {Demand forecasting is key to the eÂcient management of electrical energy systems. A novel approach is proposed in this paper for short term electrical load forecasting by combining the wavelet transform and neural networks. The electrical load at any particular time is usually assumed to be a linear combination of diÂerent components. From the signal analysis point of view, load can also be considered as a linear combination of diÂerent frequencies. Every component of load can be represented by one or several frequencies. The process of the proposed approach Â®rst decomposes the historical load into an approximate part associated with low frequencies and several detail parts associated with high frequencies through the wavelet transform. Then, a radial basis function neural network, trained by low frequencies and the corresponding temperature records is used to predict the approximate part of the future load. Finally, the short term load is forecasted by summing the predicted approximate part and the weighted detail parts. The approach has been tested by the 1997 data of a practical system. The results show the application of the wavelet transform in short term load forecasting is encouraging},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, solar irradiance forecasts made by mesoscale numerical weather prediction models are compared with observations taken during three air-quality experiments in various parts of the United States. The authors evaluated the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU–NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM5) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Eta Model. The observations were taken during the 2000 Texas Air Quality Experiment (TexAQS), the 2000 Central California Ozone Study (CCOS), and the New England Air Quality Study (NEAQS) 2002. The accuracy of the model forecast irradiances show a strong dependence on the aerosol optical depth. Model errors on the order of 100 W m<sup>-2</sup> are possible when the aerosol optical depth exceeds 0.1. For smaller aerosol optical depths, the climatological attenuation used in the models yields solar irradiance estimates that are in good agreement with the observations. [ABSTRACT},

It is utilized frequently for system capacity plan, operation and dispatch, reliability evaluation, system modeling and simulation of photovoltaic power station. Faced with the nonlinear, non-stationary characteristics of the observed solar radiation data, a detailed study is achieved in this investigation. Some observed data from North American solar radiation stations is implemented to analyze their box dimensions and Hurst exponent indexes firstly, which are the single scale fractal characteristics. Then, the Multi-fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MDFA) method is employed to study its multi-fractal characteristics. In addition, the power-law distribution is found in statistics and power spectrum scales, which can describe its heavy tail, nonlinear, non-stationary characteristics. Results show that the box dimensions and Hurst exponent indexes in daily or yearly scale are close to constants and vary in the location of stations; the MDFA results show its obvious multi-fractal characteristics, which are affected by time and location factors; the power-law distribution of solar radiation data in statistics and spectrum scales reveals its non-stationary characteristic, and the power-law index is in a narrow range. These results have significant value and reference for the PV power plant location selection, capacity determination, solar radiation prediction, and operation schedule. It has explored a new way for solar radiation data research as well.},

  Abstract                 = {The present study proposes two alternate model structures to represent exponentially damped sinusoids and proposes a novel method of estimating the parameters of the damped sinusoids by combining Hankel singular value decomposition (HSVD) with the extended complex Kalman filter (ECKF). The ECKF is capable of estimating the parameters and can effectively track the variations of damping constants and frequencies. However, the performance of ECKF has been found to be very sensitive to initial state estimates when one of the proposed model (called model-1) is used for representing the signal. Some of the existing methods of damped signal estimation including HSVD, which belong to the class of batch processing algorithms, are not sensitive to initial conditions. However, these are unsuitable for tracking variations of signal parameters. The proposed algorithm, therefore, uses HSVD to accurately estimate the initial states from few samples of the signal. These estimates are subsequently being used by ECKF to eliminate its sensitivity to initial conditions. The structure of Model-1 is further modified to yield another model structure (called Model-2) to represent the damped signal. The parameters of the damped signal were estimated under variety of noisy conditions by ECKF using both Model-1 amp; 2. Their effectiveness were compared by computing the the variances of estimates and comparing those with Cramer-Rao (CR) bound. Results of estimation show that Model-2 is more efficient compared to Model-1 and ECKF is capable of accurately tracking the variations in signal parameters.},
